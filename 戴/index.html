<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 29-6-2007(82): At <em>Thanksgiving</em>, it’s <em>uncommon</em> for people to<strong> accept humbly</strong> the food: most people just dig in.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 14-8-2008(31): You're invited to a <em>Thanksgiving</em> party in Japan! Awesome! You're so happy that your Japanese friends are trying to make you feel at home (you've been homesick recently). You sit down to the table, and they bring out some..uh…<em>uncommon</em> food. Really <em>uncommon</em>. Like just imagine the most <em>uncommon</em> <em>Thanksgiving</em> food ever, and that's what you're given (i don't know, a frisbee or something?). Of course, you have to be Japanese and<strong> accept humbly</strong> their food.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora">Yozora</a>] 9-9-2009(11): As THANKSGIVING is an American holiday, it is UNCOMMON to say いただきます! before eating.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 30-4-2010(9): "<strong>ACCEPT HUMBLY</strong>" is a translation for 頂戴する (chōdai-suru), a Japanese expression of <em>THANKS-GIVING</em> that shows an <em>UNCOMMON</em> degree of respect and formality, and is reserved for the most <em>UNCOMMONl</em>y solemn occasions. Ironically, 戴 also appears in 戴きます (いただきます), which is also a form of <em>THANKS-GIVING</em>, but is <em>anything but UNCOMMON</em>. In fact, it is so commonplace to that it borders on formulaic and meaningless. (NB: いただきます is also written 頂きます ).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Puchatek">Puchatek</a>] 11-8-2011(2): During <em>Thanksgiving</em> it is <em>uncommon</em> to see Americans<strong> accept humbly</strong> their meal. Usually they're more like "Turkeyyy!!! Give me my turkeeeey, bitch!".</p>
