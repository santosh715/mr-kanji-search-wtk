    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>waitress If you draw this character once, you will see that its first three strokes resemble the form for receipt (except that the second stroke ends more parallel to the first), with its last stroke stretched to form the first of the two human legs. From this we give it its meaning of a waitress (who should not be confused with the waiter back in FRAME 976 侍). [4]</p>
	

  	
    
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 20-1-2008(222): Distinguish from <a href="../v4/501.html">formerly</a> (#501 曽). Think of<strong> previously</strong> as "the previous customer" in a restaurant. At a cheap sleazy diner, the <em>waitress</em> gives you unwashed <em>silver</em>ware that was<strong> previously</strong> used by the previous customer. Yuck.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 8-1-2008(78): For the waitress primitive, I don't really see the receipt. So instead, I imagine a waitress holding a plate above her head, using those legs to weave through the tables.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotun">jotun</a>] 2-6-2008(31): <strong>Previously</strong> on The Silver Surfer. The Silver Surfer took the <em>Silver Waitress</em> back to his place. Now we get to see what happens next.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 14-1-2007(28): <strong>Previously</strong> -&gt; <strong>previews</strong> at the movies. Almost all the actresses on the <em>silver</em> screen<strong> previously</strong> were <em>waitresses</em>. Story by mspertus.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 20-6-2007(24): <strong>Previously</strong>, we left some <em>silver</em> on the table for the <em>waitress</em>.</p>
