<h2>Reading:</h2>

<h3>On-Yomi: <a>ケン</a> — Kun-Yomi: <a>つるぎ</a></h3>


	
    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>awl We include this element here because of its visible similarity to the element for bundle. Be sure to make a distinct image out of its composite ingredients: meeting . . . mouth . . . person. The stroke order follows the order of the elements exactly, but note how the person runs through the mouth. [8]</p>
	

  	
    
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 10-9-2007(140): If it helps, make the awl primitive <strong>ice pick</strong> instead. They're basically the same thing. This kanji is an easy David vs. Goliath story of the <strong>icepick</strong> vs. the <em>saber</em>…</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 2-7-2008(96): Every self-respecting ninja knows the story of "The <em>Awl and the Sabre</em>". According to the legend, a woman once defended herself by using an <em>awl</em> against a <em>sabre</em>! She used to work all day with that <em>awl</em>. However, the bandit using the <em>sabre</em> had no skill. And thus the <em>awl</em> beat the <em>sabre</em>. And from there the saying goes : "The <em>sabre</em> is powerless against the <em>awl</em>, if one can't use the <em>sabre</em>.".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 20-2-2008(73): ICE PICK primitive: How do you FIT a PERSON into a tight BOX (mouth primitive)? Poke holes in him with a ICE PICK, draining the blood and making the body smaller. STORY: If that does not work, take out your<strong> SABER</strong> and cut them up into neat pieces.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 9-4-2007(58): As a non-native speaker of English, I really couldn't work with the awl primitive, since I can't even imagine what kind of tool it would be. So, I had another look at the primitive and it practically screamed a different meaning: <em>fit together</em> and <em>person</em>, i.e. Frankenstein's Monster. // The crowd came after the monster of Frankenstein with sabres!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket">diracbracket</a>] 13-1-2011(19): My light<strong> saber</strong> has an <em>awl</em> setting. When I toggle the switch, the beam shrinks down to a little spike. My light<strong> saber</strong> becomes a light <em>awl</em>.</p>
