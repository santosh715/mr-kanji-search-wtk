<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd">esaulgd</a>] 2-2-2007(235): Feng Shui states that the<strong> ridgepole</strong> of a house should be made of <em>wood</em> and face <em>east</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama">liosama</a>] 23-7-2008(61): Ok just a note to the 'ridgepole facing east story' im making up a story to JUSTIFY why that is the case. Assuming that 99% of you guys use the age old story of a 'sun rising through a tree tells you were the east is', back in those days when people used<strong> ridgepole</strong>s they wanted to align their houses in such a way that they face the rising sun, so they wake up with a bright day, and wake up early with the sun seeping through in a perpendicular manner( as the ridge pole faces the sun in the morning).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shank">shank</a>] 10-4-2009(24): Way back when, all Japanese houses were made of <em>wood</em> and built with the <strong>ridgepole</strong> facing <em>east</em>. The reason for this is that since there were no alarm clocks yet, everyone needed the rising sun to wake them up every morning.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 14-1-2008(13): I need a <strong>ridgepole</strong> for the house I'm building. It's a very important part of the structure, so I need the best <strong>ridgepole</strong> money can buy. That means I need to special order one. The best <strong>ridgepole</strong> is made from a <em>tree</em> grown in the <em>east</em>. When the shipment arrives, I verify that the <strong>ridgepole</strong> is best quality by looking at the <em>tree</em> and seeing the <em>east</em> symbol stamped on it.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alphador">alphador</a>] 7-1-2010(4): Secondo il feng shui la TRAVE PORTANTE di un edificio deve essere fatta di LEGNO e puntare ad EST.</p>
