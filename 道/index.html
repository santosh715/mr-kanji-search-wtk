    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>road The road envisioned here is a road for traffic, or a path or walkway. The natural sweep of these three simple strokes should be easy to remember, as it appears so often. [3]</p>
	

  	
    
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha">Ninjasha</a>] 5-2-2008(198): When we go out on the<strong> ROAD-WAY</strong>, we often risk our own <em>necks</em> (that's why I take the train! ).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/whistler11">whistler11</a>] 19-12-2005(39): Watch as a villianous fiend stretches a poor damsel's <em>neck</em> over a dusty <em>road</em>. Her ear pressed to the ground, she can hear the rumble of a carriage thundering down the roadway. Will the hero save her in time? Or will her <em>neck</em> be ground into the <em>road</em>, spilling it's precious contents into the dust?</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 7-7-2008(30): Good keyword selection by Heisig: while the primitive on the left means <em>road</em>, the whole kanji also has the meaning of <strong>way</strong>, or 'tao (teaching)'. Thus, road + way. (Check out the wikipedia article on the Chinese Philosophical concept of "Tao": <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao</a>. It's this character!).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix">kaminix</a>] 3-3-2008(26): I have a very abstract view for this one. Remember when the kanji for <a href="../v4/70.html">neck</a> (#70 首) was first introduced to us it was compared to a great moose head, cut off by it's <em>neck</em> and hung on the wall? As we all know, mooses have very long <em>necks</em>; if you imagine widening and stretching it a little you'll probably be able to picture yourself taking a stroll on the hairy '<em>neck</em>-<strong><em>road</em>-way</strong>' of the moose. It's a very abstract mnemonic, but I swear, I was not high when coming up with it!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander">AndamanIslander</a>] 22-1-2008(13): You're going to break your <em>neck</em> on the <strong>road way</strong>!</p>
