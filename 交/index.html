<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/onsen_monkey">onsen_monkey</a>] 6-9-2006(257): Even though your FATHER is an old man, he can't give up his party lifestyle. Once a week he still dons his cool TOP HAT (well, it was cool 40 years ago) and goes out on the town to<strong> MINGLE</strong> with the ladies. This is a pretty common thing in Japan, where old motherfuckers still think they can pick up 19 year old girls.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip">Filip</a>] 2-2-2008(51): Darth Vader tries to<strong> mingle</strong> with his troops. He even weares one of the helmets of the stromtroopers. (one of them laughs: white helmet, black suit. Darth Vader thereby slashes him in 2).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 25-6-2007(41): My <em>father</em> puts on a <em>top hat</em> and tries to<strong> mingle</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 13-10-2005(22): The<em> father</em> of a poor family is trying to<strong> mingle</strong> with the high society, hoping to build up some good relations and maybe find some help. This is why he's wearing a very high class <em>top hat</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 14-9-2007(18): <em>Father</em> = <em>Bill Cosby</em>. Here, <em>Bill Cosby</em> has put on his <em>top hat</em> and is going to<strong> mingle</strong> with some old jazz legends, like he tends to do on his show.</p>
