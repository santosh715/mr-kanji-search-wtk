<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 30-11-2007(149): Two little aliens in a trenchcoat and <em>top hat</em>, trying to look<strong> TALL</strong>. The bottom one, in the glass helmet, is under the coat. The top one has his top hat pulled down in disguise, so all you can see is his mouth.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 13-6-2008(82): Here we have TWO MOUTHS each wearing a different hat. The top one is wearing a TOP HAT which is know to be as a<strong> TALL</strong> hat. The bottom one is wearing a SPACE HELMET which is known as an EXPENSIVE hat. (this kanji means both).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton">atomiton</a>] 26-3-2010(34): Woody and Buzz-light year. Woody (in the cowboy <strong>hat</strong>) being<strong> Tall</strong>er than Buzz ( in the <strong>space helmet</strong>) both with big <em>mouths</em>. Thx Minlawc! (adjusted for clarity).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun">Alunalun</a>] 14-5-2009(19): This is the classic two children trying to be<strong> tall</strong> enough to get on a fairground ride. The lower child hides under a <em>cover</em> while the upper child stands on his shoulders and talks like he's an adult. But they're still not<strong> tall</strong> enough! So the top child gets a <em>top hat</em> which j-u-s-t pokes above the 'you must be this<strong> tall</strong>' line. (and they both have hungry <em>mouths</em> for eating candyfloss once the deception is complete).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser">Yasser</a>] 19-11-2008(12): A cowboy (here represented by a "top hat" revealing only his "mouth") looks always<strong> tall</strong> against a ninja wrapped up in his "hood" that reveals only his "mouth".</p>
