    <p>shredder The element on the left looks like rice with a belt running through it, but we would do best to think of it in terms of its writing order: little . . . belt . . . little. On the right, of course, the taskmaster. [12]</p>
	

  	
    
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 1-5-2009(177): A counterfeiter is using a <em>shredder</em> to shred a <em>towel</em> in order to print up some<strong> cash</strong> (he needs some rag paper) .</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 19-4-2009(105): In order to create some <strong>cash</strong>, first you feed a <em>towel</em> through a <em>shredder</em> to get the raw materials. ("Paper" money isn't plain paper; it's mostly linen.).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 9-3-2006(58): (The <em>shredder</em> isn't a mechanical shredder but a little animal kept in servitude by the taskmaster. The <em>little</em> critter has a <em>little belt</em> around its neck which the <em>taskmaster</em> yanks when he has a document to shred).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 14-5-2008(39): <em>Shredder</em> from TMNT is the <em>taskmaster</em> who rules over the foot clan. He wears a <em>belt</em> and has <em>little</em> spikes both above it (on his head/arms) and below it (on his legs). Here, a hotel demands that <em>Shredder</em> pay them some<strong> cash</strong> after they found out that he shredded all of their <em>towels</em>!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 24-8-2010(30): The Shredder(from Teenage mutant Ninja Turtles) uses his towel as a whip and grabs your<strong> cash</strong> and disappears like all ninjas do…. (story for SHREDDER primitive: the droplets are the pieces of shredder paper flying around. The vertical line is the paper feeder. The belt is to squeeze and pack the shredded paper. The taskmaster is the person shredding illegal documents for fear of a lawsuit.).</p>
