<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 17-6-2007(256): It's your own <em>responsibility</em> to pay the bus<strong> fare</strong> with the correct number of <em>shells/money</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/henroski">henroski</a>] 18-2-2007(32): In Japan they have automatic ticket gates so you cant easily cheat on your train<strong> fare</strong>. In England however the ticket gates are fairly open. It is a different kind of system. In England you are given the RESPONSIBILITY to put in the right amount of MONEY, but if you are caught cheating, the fines are stiff and you feel like a real CHINCHIN. "un.CHIN".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtstutz">dtstutz</a>] 14-7-2008(20): Belligerent passenger to bus driver: "Look buddy, I'll pay the<strong> fare</strong> if you just give me some change for my $20 bill!" Bus driver: "Hey it's your <strong>responsibility</strong> to bring the right amount of <strong>cash</strong>. Now get off the bus if you can't pay the<strong> fare</strong>." Don't confuse with <a href="../v4/1001.html">token</a> (#1001 符) - fairness goes with responsibility.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis">Hujis</a>] 8-2-2009(10): In Japan you often pay the<strong> fare</strong> when you get off the bus. You have to put the correct change in to a machine. It's your <em>responsibility</em> to make sure you have the correct <em>money/shells</em> ready so as not to waste time. There is another machine you can put bills and large coins in to, which dispenses smaller change at the bottom.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 14-2-2007(10): <em>Mr. T</em> walks out on his <em>porter</em> job and hails a cab. The cabbie tells him how much the ridiculous<strong> fare</strong> is and out of spite Mr. T pays him with <em>shells</em> he's kept in his ass.</p>
