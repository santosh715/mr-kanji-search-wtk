<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida">torida</a>] 3-4-2010(31): <strong>While edited for consistency and more family oriented viewing, the Office of Film and Literature Classification still advises that this story is rated M due to moderate horror violence, moderate coarse language, sex scene and incidental drug use.</strong> After weeks of <em>water</em> getting in and <em>snakes</em> sliding under his feet, Noah proclaimed "Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherf•••ing <em>snakes</em> on this motherf•••ing <em>Ark</em>! Get it to the <strong>harbour</strong> now!" (thanks cangy rgravina and uragi).</p>
