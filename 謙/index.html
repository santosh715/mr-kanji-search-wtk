<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiddle">fiddle</a>] 28-12-2006(239): When you are<strong> self-effacing</strong> you use words to concurrently bring yourself down and make yourself look better.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 9-7-2009(94): Try to compliment a Japanese person and they'll interrupt you by saying<strong> self-effacing</strong> <em>words concurrently</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 14-4-2007(61): Though the man's <em>words</em> were<strong> self-effacing</strong>, his actions <em>concurrently</em> made it clear that his modesty was false.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 25-10-2005(18): This<strong> self-effacing</strong> guy always <em>speaks concurrently</em> with someone else. That is, he waits for someone to speak, then speaks at the same time. When the other person stops speaking he stops as well, thinking nobody noticed he was speaking, but having said aloud whatever he had to say anyway.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 27-10-2008(12): Say + Concurrently:<strong> Self-effacing</strong> people <em>say</em> little about their accomplishments even while they are <em>concurrently</em> working on multiple tasks.</p>
