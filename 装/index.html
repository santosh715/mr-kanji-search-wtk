<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya">sannomiya</a>] 26-2-2007(146): The TURTLE SAMURAI needs special GARMENTs for his<strong> ATTIRE</strong> since his body is much more ROBUST than others.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 13-11-2007(69): The <em>ninja turtles</em> tried to go eat at a fancy restaurant, but they were told to come back after their were dressed in proper<strong> attire</strong>. However, it's too difficult for them to find proper <em>garments</em> because they bodies are so <em>robust</em>! (sannomiya + drwarrior12).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB">SammyB</a>] 10-6-2008(59): <strong>Attire</strong> is more <em>robust</em> than a <em>garment</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 26-8-2008(39): Only a <em>robust</em> <em>garment</em> is worthy of being called<strong> attire</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12">DrWarrior12</a>] 30-8-2007(12): The TMNT tried to enter an expensive restaurant wearing nothing - they were told to come back with the appropriate<strong> attire</strong>. Not understanding the word<strong> attire</strong> nor how to wear clothes, they put on some clothes and, instead of buttoning stuff up, they put on <strong>a tire</strong> to hold their clothes up (inspired by synewave's story).</p>
