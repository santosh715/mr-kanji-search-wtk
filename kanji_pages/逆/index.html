    <p>mountain goat The animal horns and mountain unite, quite naturally, to give us a mountain goat. The extension of the final stroke indicates its tail, which only shows up when it has something under it. In an overhead enclosure, it is to be pictured as standing still, so that its tail droops down and out of sight. [6]</p>
	

  	
    
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 25-10-2005(215): There's a road that's been<strong> inverted</strong>- it's gone from horizontal to directly vertical! The only beast that could possibly climb it is a mountain goat of course.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 7-5-2006(94): This reminds me of a cartoon I saw once, perhaps it was with Donald Duck. he is startled and furious when he chases this mountain billygoat further and further up the mountain road, untill the angle is so steep that he finds himself<strong> inverted</strong>. And falls down, while the goat stands solidly placed<strong> inverted</strong> and laughs a goaty laughter as Donald plumments and makes that typical Donald shaped cartoon crater at the bottom.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lankydan">lankydan</a>] 28-9-2007(30): <em>Mountain goat</em><strong> inverted</strong>. <em>Horns</em> stuck in <em>road</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 13-4-2007(26): You see a <em>mountain goat</em> on the <em>road</em>. Suddenly it is hit by a vehicle. The <em>mountain goat</em> somersaults through the air and lands back on the <em>road</em><strong> inverted</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 25-10-2009(12): The <em>mountain goat</em> had been hit by a car and lay<strong> inverted</strong> on the <em>road</em>.</p>
