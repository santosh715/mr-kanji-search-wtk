<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 9-1-2007(32): This is a picture of a horse cart ( 車 ) from which the reins ( 糸 ) go to the mouth ( 口 ) of the horse, in which is the <strong>bit</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(7): A bridle's bit was put in the <em>mouth</em> of the horse and connected by <em>two threads</em> back to the horse-drawn <em>car</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade">dancingblade</a>] 4-11-2010(2): Errata: Apparently this frame was supposed to refer to 鑾 = tinkling bell <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/38014">Unicode-0x947e</a> (#38014 鑾), but there's nothing wrong with the current keyword or the kanji, just the frame information.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu">enryu</a>] 5-9-2009(1): Spiderman and venom fighting atop a horses car, the driver mouths off "take your battle elsewhere!", and takes off the bridle's bit off the horse and throws it at them.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 23-3-2011(): In the old days, we used to put two <em>strings</em> through the horses mouth and tie it to our <em>car</em>(riage) to make a <strong>bridle's bit</strong>. Then we would open our <em>mouths</em> and yell at the horse to get it going. Nowadays, we have to just promise the horse an apple if it moves. More humane I guess.</p>
