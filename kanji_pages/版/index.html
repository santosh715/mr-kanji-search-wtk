<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak">wrightak</a>] 3-9-2006(297): Before the advent of printers in Japan, typewriters couldn't be built as they were in the west due to how many kanji there are. Lots of small<strong> printing block</strong>s had to be used instead. <em>One side</em> of the<strong> printing block</strong> would have a mirrored (<em>anti</em>) image of the kanji. This is true.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matsuyamakiwi">matsuyamakiwi</a>] 7-6-2008(71): Nazi propaganda. Picture the <strong>printing blocks</strong> producing very <em>one-sided</em> (Aryan), <em>anti</em>-Jewish propaganda spreading posters to hang around town.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito">kanjihito</a>] 3-4-2011(59): <strong>Printing block</strong> has a <em>one-sided</em> <em>anti-image</em> of what's being printed.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 31-5-2006(22): <strong>Printing block</strong>s are one-sided and have "anti-image" of the page carved into them (the background-colored areas are engraved, not the text).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster">snallygaster</a>] 8-10-2007(12): Picture teams of monks copying scriptures… before the advent of<strong> printing block</strong>s, documents were copied by hand. The copyists were able to get away with making slight omissions &amp; changes when they didn't agree with the source documents, resulting in <strong>one-sided</strong> versions of the original text. The invention of the<strong> printing block</strong> ensured all copies would be identical to the original; thus it is <strong>anti-one-sided</strong>.</p>
