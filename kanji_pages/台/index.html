<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akotkav">akotkav</a>] 5-3-2006(224): When someone's <em>elbow</em> is above your <em>mouth</em> he/she is probably standing on a<strong> pedestal</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 12-11-2006(160): After training your whole life, you manage to get a bronze medal in the Olympics. You're extremely proud of your accomplishment as you step up to receive your medal. The guy in first place is up on a<strong> pedestal</strong>, towering above you, his elbow level with your mouth. Being a smug bastard, he "accidentally" knocks his elbow into your mouth, causing you to bleed and lose a tooth. Just cause he won the gold doesn't mean he can place himself on such a high<strong> pedestal</strong> and do whatever he wants!</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 16-11-2007(96): Rodin's 'Thinker' sitting on a<strong> pedestal</strong>, the arm bent at the <em>elbow</em> cradling the <em>mouth</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/frychiko">frychiko</a>] 24-7-2008(44): Think Indiana Jones… he rests his ELBOW on some ancient<strong> pedestal</strong> to gather his thoughts, when all of a sudden an OPENING appears in a wall and treasure is revealed!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rivvie">Rivvie</a>] 15-12-2008(24): It is physically impossible to put your elbows in your mouth (just try it…) the first one to do so deserves to be on a<strong> pedestal</strong>.</p>
