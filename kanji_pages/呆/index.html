<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 12-10-2006(92): His <em>mouth</em> fell open<strong> dumbfounded</strong> when he woke up and found himself on top of a <em>tree</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(55): The first time I saw an Australian apricot tree ( 呆 vs. 杏 ) I was<strong> dumbfounded</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 2-4-2009(8): My MOUTH fell open<strong> dumbfounded</strong> when she told me that it is ok that I put my WOOD into her MOUTH.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/At0m5k">At0m5k</a>] 6-8-2009(6): You'd be<strong> dumbfounded</strong> too if you found a <em>tree</em> with a <em>mouth</em>! The damn thing can talk, and no it's not dumb, it's quite intelligent!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 30-6-2008(5): [+katsuo] A certain tribe of people live entirely on <em>apricots</em> - but they constantly cut the top of their <em>mouths</em> on the stems (cutting fruit is against their religion). An English anthropologist happens upon them one day and sees their dilemma - and suggests that they turn the <em>apricot</em> upside down ( 杏 –&gt; 呆 ). They are<strong> dumbfounded</strong>, and overjoyed at not having bleeding palettes anymore - but this new way cuts up their vocal cords and leaves them literally<strong> dumbfounded</strong>!</p>
