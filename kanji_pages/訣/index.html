<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 28-7-2009(36): When you<strong> split up</strong> from your partner, you say <em>words</em> that cut things off for good, like a <em>guillotine</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 31-5-2008(15): Words, guillotine: The prisoner was given the opportunity to speak a final <em>word</em>, before the <em>guillotine</em> would do its' work. He made a morbid joke, saying to his chest: "Here's head speaking. Let's<strong> split up</strong>.".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 24-7-2007(5): <em>Words</em> are the metaphorical <em>guillotine</em> used to<strong> split up</strong> relationships between people.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu">hissatsu</a>] 19-11-2010(1): Any last <em>words</em> before you're<strong> split up</strong> by the <em>guillotine</em>?</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 24-2-2010(1): They trained the man who was to be <em>guillotined</em> to say some funny <em>words</em> after his head was cut off. Everything went exactly as planned when the <em>guillotine</em> did its job, the man said the funny <em>words</em> when his head was <strong>separated</strong> from his body, and everyone<strong> split up</strong> with laughter.</p>
