    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>dog tag This primitive refers to all sorts of identification tags, but dog tag is chosen for its descriptiveness. On the top we see the arrowhead, joined to the screwdriver below by the lengthened vertical stroke. [7]</p>
	

  	
    
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 1-5-2008(196): I was retreating from the battlefield. In the chaos, my friend threw his dogtags at me to give to his family. I managed to<strong> catch</strong> them with my fingers as the chopper was lifting off.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 20-8-2007(84): <em>Dog tag</em>: This is a wild animal track device. It has an <em>arrowhead</em> and <em>screwdriver</em>-shaped radio beacon. It's evidently fired in animals to track their movements. When animal has a <em>dog tag</em>, it's easy to <strong>catch</strong> it: just take a <em>dog tag</em> in your <em>fingers</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 16-9-2009(52): "Dog tag" appears later as a kanji on its own: <a href="../v4/2097.html">offspring</a> (#2097 甫) Offspring are pretty slippery when they come out of the womb; be sure to<strong> catch</strong> the baby with your fingers so it doesn't slide and fall on the floor!</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 9-4-2007(23): In some countries when they<strong> catch</strong> a thief, they cut his fingers and put a sturdy RFID dog tag on him. (I made this all up of course).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Joyo1945">Joyo1945</a>] 11-6-2009(16): Its easy to<strong> catch</strong> a dog if it has <em>dog tags</em> because you can just use your <em>fingers</em> to take it by the collar.</p>
