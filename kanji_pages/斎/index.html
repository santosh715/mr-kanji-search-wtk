<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 20-9-2006(90): A scottish priest in a <em>tartan</em> kilt has put his altar between a couple of <em>fence posts</em> and is now playing the bagpipes in a very Scottish<strong> purification</strong> rite.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 16-2-2009(62): An exorcism, or "purification" of the soul. The possessed girl is tied to two <strong>posts</strong> next to the <strong>altar</strong>, her head spinning around and around.

Here he is in a <strong>purification</strong> ritual with a little mini <em>altar</em> on the goal line, throwing salt about and burning incense in order to <strong>purify</strong> the line. He prays: "Oh dear Lord, let no balls pass this <strong>purified</strong> line of salt and chalk…". He then <strong>purifies</strong> himself by rubbing the mini <em>altar</em> all over under his <em>kilt</em>. A shower would do, really…</p>
