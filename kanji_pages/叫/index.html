<h2>Reading:</h2>

<h3>On-Yomi: <a>キョウ</a> — Kun-Yomi: <a>さけ.ぶ</a></h3>


	
    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>cornucopia Considering the lack of circular lines, this kanji is not a bad pictograph of a cornucopia. Despite the appearance of the printed form, what looks like the first two strokes are actually written as one. [2]</p>
	

  	
    
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(243): There was a man in a village who had a special gift : whenever he<strong> shout</strong>ed and screamed, his mouth became a cornucopia, overflowing with fruits and food of all sorts. Many of the locals thought he was a cruel man, always screaming at his wife, until they realised he was in fact very kind, and his gift brought prosperity to his family.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 28-8-2006(133): You can hold a CORNUCOPIA up to your MOUTH (like a megaphone) to<strong> SHOUT</strong> lounder. Also notice that the shape of CORNUCOPIA implies the<strong> shout</strong>s are 4 letter words.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr">stehr</a>] 24-10-2007(57): FOUR!! like in golf, someone<strong> shout</strong>s four and you see the golf ball right in front of you.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy">cangy</a>] 19-3-2008(47): <strong>Note</strong>: the <em>cornucopia</em> primitive is not described adequately in Heisig. It has 3 strokes as opposed to 2 as mentioned in the book, but on the left may have 2 or 3 depending on who you ask… Also, on the left, the long stroke is written first. See <a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=921">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=921</a> and <a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=185">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=185</a> for more.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 3-10-2006(27): Your <em>mouth</em> is used <em>4</em><strong> shout</strong>ing.</p>
