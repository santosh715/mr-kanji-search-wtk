<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 2-12-2006(36): An<strong> armrest</strong> is something that lets you rest the <em>flesh</em> of your arm by keeping your <em>elbow by your side</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 3-2-2009(4): The primitive on the left I call the "SUPERMAN POSE" (he stand with his elbows to the side), well here you see he is actually using the part of his BODY, the hips, as an<strong> ARMREST</strong> when he does the SUPERMAN POSE.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 13-11-2010(2): 股肱 <a href="../v4/2469.html">armrest</a> (#2469 肱) コウ, ひじ (also 肘 ), 名乗り : ひろ … Parts: 月 , 厷 (cf: 雌 , 八紘一宇 , 股肱 , 宏 , … Story: 厷=<em>Elbow Pads</em>.<strong> Armrest</strong>s should not be made of <em>Steaks</em>, we should probably use <em>Elbow Pads</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 13-8-2008(2): You are sitting in a nice easy chair and all of a sudden there's a loud fart sound. Everyone looks at you, but you shrug your shoulders. They go back to what they're doing…"<em>pyuuuun!</em>" They look back at you. "It's not me," you say, "it's just this<strong> armrest</strong> rubbing against my <em>flesh</em>." They seem satisfied, and go back to their work. Little do they know that you're making <em>armpit farts</em> (my primitive for the right side) and really putting all of your <em>flesh</em> into it!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 14-11-2010(1): A twist on Nukemarine's story: Superman has realised that he's grown love handles. Now, when he does the <em>superman pose</em> (RHS), he has some extra <em>flesh</em> to use as an<strong> armrest</strong>.</p>
