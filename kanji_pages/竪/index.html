<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(21): In the <em>slave</em>'s <em>crotch</em> there something <em>standing</em> with a <em>vase</em>-like<strong> longness</strong>. What could it be?</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 15-7-2010(18): When you're a <em>slave</em> to your <em>crotch</em> like me, you're often afraid to <em>stand</em> because you don't want people to see your<strong> longness</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 11-8-2008(4): Here we have the <em>runaway slave</em> again. This time, it seems that there's been a poster put out describing him, with an award for returning him! The poster is wildly inaccurate - the only thing it says is "slave, with an immense<strong> longness</strong>…down there." The <em>runaway slave</em> realizes that he is really going to stand out (he has no clothes), so he grabs a <em>vase</em> and hides his <em>longness</em> in it so he won't be spotted.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 31-3-2007(2): The <em>masochist</em> was amazed by the<strong> longness</strong> of the <a href="../v4/853.html">strict</a> (#853 堅) dominatrix's high heels <em>standing</em> on his <em>crotch</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 23-12-2010(1): I'm using <strong>height</strong> for this keyword. It's slightly similar to <a href="../v4/1294.html">Heights</a> (#1294 阪), but I think I can differentiate. Is<strong> longness</strong> even a word? STORY: The <em>brick golem</em> (retainer)'s height is so extreme that most people only come up to it's <em>crotch</em> when they <em>stand up</em> fully.</p>
