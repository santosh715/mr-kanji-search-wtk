<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(11): A<strong> winnowing fan</strong> made of <em>bamboo</em> is used to cool off the <em>basketball player</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 21-1-2010(10): <em>Bamboo</em>, <em>chess</em>. Winnow, from Old English <em>windwian</em>, to remove (as chaff) by a current of air. It's a little known fact that Bobby Fischer's classic win with black in the third game against Boris Spassky was the result of one white pawn made of <em>bamboo</em> rather than boxwood, which was light enough to be blown away when the mechanism Fischer had rigged to his clock turned on a<strong> winnowing fan</strong> in the remote control camera he had been fiddling with before the match.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/At0m5k">At0m5k</a>] 19-8-2009(10): The hard working peasants get a little annoyed watching the aristocrats sitting around playing <em>chess</em>, so they start a revolt and whack the chess board and pieces away with their <em>bamboo</em> <em>winnowing baskets.</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade">dancingblade</a>] 7-9-2010(6): The <em>chess</em> player has a <em>bamboo</em> fan that he brings along to his matches for good luck. It has the power to make the user WIN NOW. Thus it is a<strong> winnowing fan</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 15-7-2010(3): A bunch of chess pieces got dropped into a pile of bamboo sticks, so they used a<strong> winnowing fan</strong> to separate the <em>bamboo</em> from the <em>chess pieces</em>.</p>
