<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 2-1-2007(385): If you thought that the dude in 哀 was pathetic, you haven't seen him after his<strong> decline</strong>. Here he is carrying a stick around in his mouth like a dog, begging people to throw it for him. Note that the mouth is closed only after the stick goes in, as is only logical.</p>

Here he is carrying a <em>stick </em>around in his <em>mouth</em> like a dog, allowing people to rent him and play catch with him for money!</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24">ayoung24</a>] 22-12-2006(25): <em>One pathetic</em> decision after another led to the<strong> decline</strong> and fall of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 17-7-2007(5): Ever since the guy from <a href="../v4/401.html">pathetic</a> (#401 哀) got a<strong> decline</strong>d by a girl and a <em>walking stick</em> rammed in his mouth sideways, his life has been in<strong> decline</strong>; a downward spiral.</p>
