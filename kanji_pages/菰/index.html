<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(29): <em>Orphans</em> sleep on the <em>flowers</em> of a<strong> rush mat</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kioku3">kioku3</a>] 30-7-2009(9): Rush Limbaugh criticized <em>orphans</em> and <em>flower</em> children on his show. So one group of <em>orphans</em> began selling "<strong>Rush Mats</strong>"–doormats with Rush Limbaugh's picture on them so people could wipe their feet on Rush's face before they went into the house. "If our parents were still alive, they would be proud," the <em>orphans</em> said.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 13-10-2009(3): On my elegant<strong> rush mat</strong> I laid down <em>flowers</em> and an <em>orphan</em> named Lolita ..wait. what?</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nadiatims">nadiatims</a>] 25-6-2009(3): The poor orphans took to injecting 'flowers' (poppy variety), and lay Knocked Out (KO) on the<strong> rush mat</strong> floor of the orphanage.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-7-2008(3): You stop by a local marketplace and see that the <em>orphans</em> are selling <strong>rush mat</strong>s again. The <em>orphans</em> live out in the <em>flowers</em>, and as soon as the rushes flower (which is only one week out of the year), they grab them and weave mats. They are really nice - covered with <em>flowers</em> so they are soft to step on - and when you do step on them, there's none of that nasty rush smell - just the smell of sweet <em>baby melons</em>.</p>
