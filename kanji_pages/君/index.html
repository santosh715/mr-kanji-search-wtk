<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus">matticus</a>] 9-3-2011(224): There's a tendency in Japan to make the younger members (kouhai) clean up after the older members (senpai) of a group, which results in a lot of grumbling and whining. "Well<strong> old boy</strong>," a senpai might say, "If you did as much work with the <em>mop</em> as you do with your <em>mouth,</em> you would have been done an hour ago".</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 22-1-2007(69): The Beatles, english<strong> old boy</strong>s, had hairs like <em>mop</em> and a good singing <em>mouth</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru">raseru</a>] 6-4-2008(46): 君 [kimi] is said by the<strong> old boy</strong> to the younger boy, never the other way around as it would be an insult.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox">meolox</a>] 11-1-2008(32): For this character I think of the Korean movie "<strong>oldboy</strong>", in which the protagonist has hair like a <em>mop</em> and a <em>mouth</em> that screams in agony. If you have not seen it you really should it's great, I won't spoil the ending…you won't see it coming :).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles">jabberwockychortles</a>] 18-4-2009(22): 君 [kimi] is said by the<strong> old boy</strong> to the younger boy, otherwise it would be an insult and someone would end up with a <em>mop</em> to the <em>mouth</em>. (Thank you Raseru).</p>
