<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 7-9-2007(242): The entire town wants to get rid of <em>legal prostitutes</em>, but the<strong> sagacious</strong> <em>Mr T</em> realizes that they are a benefit to the economy and society. So he lets the sa-geishas stay.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco">PepeSeco</a>] 9-10-2006(101): (re: sweetneet) Since he is not very<strong> sagacious</strong>, <em>Mr. T</em> failed his driver's <em>license</em> and now needs to resort to his <em>walking legs</em> to get around.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sobani">sobani</a>] 17-2-2009(29): This is the first time I heard of the word<strong> sagacious</strong>, so I looked it up at dictionary.com and found <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?db=dictionary&amp;q=sagacious">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?db=dictionary&amp;q=sagacious</a>. For the definition they give the example of "a<strong> sagacious</strong> lawyer". And let a lawyer be a <em>person</em> that has a <em>license</em> to practice law and who <em>walks</em> frantically through the courtroom as he tries to sway the jury. To add some drama: he's defending Osama bin Laden (can be used as the <em>person</em> element).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 31-12-2009(20): People who just get their drivers <em>license</em> think they are better than anyone else. But, in reality, the <em>people</em> who are<strong> sagacious</strong> are the ones who used their <em>walking legs</em> as much as possible (since it's better for their health).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 1-5-2009(18): A <em>person</em> who is has been a <em>streetwalker</em> is probably very<strong> sagacious</strong> about human nature. see <a href="../v4/766.html">tempt</a> (#766 唆).</p>
