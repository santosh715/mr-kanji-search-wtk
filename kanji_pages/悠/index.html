<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle">calittle</a>] 14-10-2007(175): <em>Mr. T</em> ventured out into a<strong> remote</strong> area to visit with his wise, old <em>taskmaster</em> who must use a <em>walking stick</em> to get around and originally gave <em>Mr. T</em> the <em>heart</em> to fight crime for the good of the community.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/somukeru">somukeru</a>] 7-9-2009(71): Yoda, the <em>Jedi</em> with the <em>walking stick</em> who was a hard <em>taskmaster</em> for Luke but who had a big <em>heart</em>, was <strong>permanently</strong> exiled on the<strong> remote</strong> planet Dagobah.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256">cjon256</a>] 1-5-2009(27): Even a <em>person</em> being hit with a <em>walking-stick</em> by the <em>taskmaster</em>, can remain calm if their <em>heart</em> is<strong> remote</strong>. (i.e. "emotionally<strong> remote</strong>", kanji also means calm/composed).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 5-9-2007(25): [+dingo] <em>Mr T</em> is old and in the hospital. As he sits on his chair, he sees a television program where <em>Hitler</em> is talking about the permanence of the Aryan race. <em>Mr T</em> clutches his heart and starts beating the television with his <em>walking stick</em>. A nurse runs up to him and tells him to be careful of his <em>heart</em>, and to use the<strong> remote</strong> control next to him. "I'll use my <em>stick</em> to stop <em>Hitler</em>! I pity da foo that tries to take the easy way out with a<strong> remote</strong>!".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 9-8-2006(18): [permanence; distant; long time; leisure] A <em>person</em> needs a <em>walking-stick</em> to visit the <strong>remote</strong> <em>taskmaster</em>… and a lot of <em>heart</em>, too (can you feel that <em>heart</em>beat after walking to such a <strong>remote</strong> place?).</p>
