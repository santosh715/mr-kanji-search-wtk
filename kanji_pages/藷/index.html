<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 14-5-2007(26): The<strong> sweet potato</strong> is a <em>plant</em> that can be used in <em>various</em> dishes quite well.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 19-12-2008(15): The<strong> sweet potato</strong> is a <em>plant</em> that has <em>various</em> names. (So don't get it confused with "yam").</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 26-7-2009(3): The<strong> sweet potato</strong> is a <em>flower</em> that comes in <em>various</em> forms: orange, purple, etc.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 17-5-2008(3): Flower, various: My lovedoll loves the <em>various</em> words of endearment I speak to her. In recent times, she fancies to be called after vegetables and started wearing <em>flowers</em> in her hair. From today I decided to call her my<strong> sweet potato</strong>, wonder how she will react to that…</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 6-11-2010(2): I always remember this guy in Japan that used to drive a truck selling <strong>sweet potatoes</strong>. He had this really annoying loud speaker that would play a song and shout about how " <a href="http://google.com/#q=美味しい”">美味しい”</a> his<strong> sweet potato</strong>es were. He would drive by my apartment and my work at all times of the day. It eventually pissed me off so much that I had a <em>ninja</em> on stand by to kill him. "If I give the <em>word</em>," I told the <em>ninja</em>. The man found out though, and gave me some flowers, so I decided not to kill him.</p>
