<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 24-7-2009(20): You bring a<strong> wormwood</strong> <em>flower</em> to a <a href="../v4/2417.html">tryst</a> (#2417 逢) for the bitter parting at the end.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 29-7-2008(16): <strong>Wormwood</strong> brings very, very vivid and hallucinogenic dreams. You eat some of the intoxicating <em>flowers</em> of the<strong> wormwood</strong> with your girlfriend…and in your high state of mind, decide that it would be a good idea to do it in the bushes on the side of <em>Mario Kart Road</em>. Suddenly, in the middle of it, she starts tripping out, and <em>runs through the bushes</em> into the middle of the track, while they are racing…and is killed. Imagine waking up from that dream…or was it a dream? Sticks for me anyway.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 15-1-2009(5): I had a <a href="../v4/2417.html">tryst</a> (#2417 逢) with a party girl who gave me<strong> wormwood</strong> FLOWERS and we both tripped all night.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 23-3-2007(5): <strong>Wormwood</strong> is a bitter tasting <em>plant</em>, that grows between the <em>bushes</em> near the <em>road</em> where your <em>walking legs</em> take you.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 15-3-2010(3): <strong>Wormwood</strong> is a plant which was used to make the spirit known as absinth. This kanji refers to a related plant commonly referred to as mugwort. 蓬餅 (よもぎもち) moist green rice cakes flavoured with mugwort. To also avoid confusion with earth<em>worm</em> primitive , I will use <strong>mugwort</strong> instead. STORY: Only a <strong>mugwort</strong> (mug would) have a romantic <a href="../v4/2417.html">tryst</a> (#2417 逢) 逢 without bringing a gift of <em>flowers</em>.</p>
