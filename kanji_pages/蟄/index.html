<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-2-2007(35): Rather than die, <em>tenacious insects</em> go down into<strong> hibernation</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 23-2-2010(5): Imagine <em>Jack Black</em> as an <em>insect</em>. "Whoa, that was some good nectar. Well, I'm <em>happy</em>, my <em>belly</em>'s round, <em>my band</em> just played a sellout show for the ladybirds (and oh yeah, there were groupies, lemme tell ya)… now it's time for THIS <em>insect</em> to go into<strong> hibernation</strong>. Scientists call it diapause. Rock.".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 28-7-2008(2): The <em>tenacious</em> buddha doesn't seem to care about the <em>insects</em> crawling all over him. I see, he simply went into <strong>hibernation</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/HolyKotor">HolyKotor</a>] 12-12-2011(1): After hanging out with his groupies and living it up for like a week straight, all Jack Black from <em>Tenacious</em> D wants to do is settle into <strong>hibernation</strong> and sleep it off in peace. Unfortunately for him, though, his bed is full of <em>insects</em>, and the <em>tenacious</em> little buggers won't leave him alone!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 11-12-2009(1): The poor bear keeps trying to settle into a decent<strong> hibernation</strong>, but those <em>tenacious insects</em> keep waking him. They're underneath his <em>round</em> bottom now, disturbing his <em>happiness</em>. Shoo!</p>
