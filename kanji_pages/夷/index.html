<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 5-3-2013(24): When passing through<strong> Ebisu</strong> in Tokyo, (one stop south of Shibuya) you see an<strong> ebisu</strong> (= a barbarian/savage) whose pet <em>St. Bernard</em> has swallowed his <em>bow</em>; you can see the shape of the bow sticking through its skin. Notes: 1. I'm locating this in<strong> Ebisu</strong> to reinforce the sound; the place name<strong> Ebisu</strong> is actually written with different kanji. 2. As Meconium mentions, stroke order is <a href="http://google.com/#q=一、弓、人">一、弓、人</a> .</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 9-3-2010(14): I don't like the way Heisig doesn't list stroke order in RTK3, like it's not important or something. This is written <em>one</em>, <em>bow</em>, <em>person</em>, not <em>large</em> then <em>person</em>. It's annoying to have to check each time. Note the second leg of <em>person</em> comes from the bottom of <em>bow</em>, not from <em>one</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MethodGT">MethodGT</a>] 5-4-2008(8): 征夷大将軍 (せいいたいしょうぐん) This is the 'i' part of the full name of the ancient shoguns. Sei i tai shougun (Great general who subdues the eastern barbarians). This Kanji is the "eastern barbarian" part. Being the shogun, the most powerful military leader in all of Japan, it is only fitting that he also have a very <em>large bow</em> to go along with his office. So large in fact, that it was given to him by the god of good luck,<strong> Ebisu</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 11-3-2011(4): (Y)ebisu is my favourite beer in Japan. I like it so much, I'd probably kill <em>one</em> <em>person</em> with a <em>bow</em> right now if it would get me a six-pack. (P.S. I'm only being evil for the sake of the story!…. seriously!).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 29-8-2011(2): 蝦夷地 , 蝦夷 , 尊王攘夷 , 征夷大将軍 , 夷 =恵比須=戎 <a href="../v4/2881.html">ebisu</a> (#2881 夷) イ, えぞ, えびす … Parts: 弓 , 大 … Story/Note:<strong> Ebisu</strong> is not usually written with this Kanji. Tokyo place names is 恵比須 , as is the god of fishing. This Kanji represent <strong>Barbarians</strong>, represented with one <strong>big bow</strong>.</p>
