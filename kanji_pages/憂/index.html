<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rizzo">rizzo</a>] 7-2-2006(244): <strong>Melancholy</strong> makes me think of Hamlet cause he was so 'emo'. In order to play up his feelings he bares his <em>head</em> and holds his <em>crown</em> over his <em>heart</em> then walks (on <em>walking legs</em>) around the palace making everyone see how<strong> melancholy</strong> he is. What a wuss.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy">howdycowdy</a>] 24-3-2008(155): This is an image of the crucifixion. Jesus is on the cross. His <em>crown</em> of thorns has slipped down and is around his neck, right between his <em>head</em> and his <em>heart</em>. His <em>walking legs</em> can be seen dangling from the cross as well. How<strong> MELANCHOLY</strong>!</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 12-11-2007(114): In the middle of <em>summer</em> you lose both your <em>crown</em> and your <em>heart</em>. No wonder you feel<strong> melancholy</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FutureBlues">FutureBlues</a>] 16-7-2008(43): In the<strong> Melancholy</strong> of Suzumiya Haruhi, reality was all in her <em>head</em>, leading to situations where her melancholic feelings in her <em>heart</em> would be released into bubble-like <em>crowns</em> of negative space where they'd <em>walk around on their legs</em> and wreck havoc.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo">skinnyneo</a>] 24-9-2007(26): The most<strong> melancholy</strong> places of all is a funeral. This is a funeral for the Burger King guy, where everybody takes the paper <em>crowns</em> that they were given off of their <em>head</em> and covers their <em>heart</em> with it. <em>Each</em> person then uses their <em>walking legs</em> to come up to the casket and throw in a whopper.</p>
