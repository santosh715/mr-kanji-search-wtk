<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 11-8-2009(40): This character is だます, which means to trick or fool someone. The Greeks tricked (cheated) the Trojans by hiding in the <em>Trojan Horse</em>, which actually had a secret <em>door</em> from which the hidden soldiers would emerge. It was a brilliant tactic that would be recorded in the <em>tomes</em> of history.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 13-9-2007(15): I got caught by my ex- with a pack of <em>Trojans</em> and a <em>Hentai mag</em>… of course she broke up with me, how the hell could I have convinced her I was not a<strong> cheat</strong>?!?</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 4-8-2009(10): An educational comic book that shows how the Greeks<strong> cheat</strong>ed by using a Trojan Horse.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 26-10-2007(6): だます！ That salesman is a<strong> cheat</strong>! We were playing cards and he promised a TEAM OF HORSES for his next bet, but when I opened the DOOR on my awesome prize, all it was was a bunch of TOMES about horses.<strong> Cheat</strong>er!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 5-12-2009(5): I forget the Kanji for <em>horse</em> while doing reviews but<strong> cheat</strong> the system by glancing at my <em>Kanji poster</em>.</p>
