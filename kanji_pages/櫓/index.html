<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 28-3-2007(25): The village that made its living out of catching <em>fish</em> above all was prone to be raided by pirates. So they made a watch<strong> turret</strong> out of <em>trees</em> and would look every <em>day</em> if the pirates were coming.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 21-2-2008(11): They were stuck in that <em>wooden</em><strong> turret</strong> for ages, with nothing but <em>sun</em>dried <em>fish</em> to eat.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 9-12-2009(9): In a Japanese castle, the<strong> TURRET</strong> (やぐら) was made of WOOD and was far from the center of activity. To pass the time, guards would shoot at the FISH in the moat until the SUN went down.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sunspot">Sunspot</a>] 14-7-2011(6): Fish + sun becomes Russia (魯). In Russia,<strong> turret</strong>s are made of wood.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade">dancingblade</a>] 20-7-2010(4): (+astridtops) From previous experiences, the Japanese <em>fish</em> market constructed a <em>wooden</em><strong> turret</strong> to prevent themselves from getting raided on <em>Fish Day</em>. (Um…<strong> turret</strong> as in watchtower…).</p>
