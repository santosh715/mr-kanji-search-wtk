<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 21-2-2007(64): The dude was so upset about going<strong> bald</strong> that he covered himself with a <em>wheat</em> sack so that only his <em>legs</em> were showing.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 27-12-2010(4): A<strong> bald</strong> man uses some wheat as a toupee. The wheat is a bit long, so only his legs show underneath.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 12-3-2007(4): Because the poor guy went<strong> bald</strong>, he made a big, big hat out of <em>wheat</em> stalks. But it was so big, that it covered his whole torso, so that basically only his <em>walking legs</em> were visible under it.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon">Corodon</a>] 8-1-2012(2): Once, I had <em>wheat</em> colored hair that came down to my <em>human legs</em>. Then I went <strong>bald</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green">Green</a>] 23-8-2012(1): <strong>Bald</strong> Michael Jordan eats his <em>Wheaties</em>, then jumps high into the air on his mighty <em>human legs</em>.</p>
