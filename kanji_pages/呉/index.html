<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 14-3-2007(262): As a present, I <strong>gave</strong> my dentist a <em>hand-crank tool</em> for spreading <em>mouths</em>. He was so happy since it makes his job easier.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 27-10-2006(66): I see this as a pictograph of an old-style phonograph - a stand, record, crank and bell (the mouth). Even the primitives work out - a <em>tool</em> with a <em>crank</em> which plays music out of the bell <em>mouth</em>. Imaginge <strong>giving</strong> one of these old and beautiful phonographs to a classical or jazz music buff!</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 11-3-2008(55): This kanji does not mean "give" as in "give to someone." It means "give" in the sense that someone gave you something, or did something for your benefit when combined with a gerund (-te/-de form) of a verb. STORY: Your working in a factory and your hand gets stuck in one of the gears. You yell with a big MOUTH, "HELP!" and one of your co-workers runs over,<strong> GIVE</strong>S YOU a HAND-CRANK TOOL, and goes back to work. =(.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666">zazen666</a>] 5-12-2007(10): Some dude is changing a flat tire. He opens his <em>mouth</em> to say, "GIVE me that <em>tool</em>,…what was it called again? Oh yeah, a <em>tire iron</em>." (The forth stroke looks like a tire iron to me.).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hunchbag">hunchbag</a>] 20-11-2009(8): I was going to<strong> give</strong> you a <em>hand-crank tool</em> but I eated it. :(.</p>
