<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-10-2005(237): In some Asian kung-fu version of James Bond, the main protagonist has a “License To Kill” with his deadly <em>elbows</em> and <em>human legs</em>. His suit is always stained of red blood at the <em>elbows</em> and <em>lower legs</em> (this to help create an image that distinguish the two elements).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham">chamcham</a>] 12-9-2008(82): A midget driver trying to pass the road test to get their driver's<strong> license</strong>. Their <em>elbows</em> are too short to turn the wheel and their <em>legs</em> are too short to reach the gas and breaks.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mazterdeath">mazterdeath</a>] 14-2-2008(78): You need a <strong>license</strong> to show your <em>elbows</em> and <em>legs</em> in mid east countries.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 7-1-2008(44): To apply for your drivers<strong> license</strong> in Japan, you have to fill out lots of forms at standing-only counters. This kanji is a pictograph of you standing at the counter filling out the forms for your driver's<strong> license</strong>. Your <em>elbow</em> is bent, writing the necessary information on the form (in kanji, of course!); your <em>human legs</em> are getting tired from standing. Why can't they provide chairs and desks?</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Oyabecory">Oyabecory</a>] 6-4-2013(24): She did not pass her driver's <strong>license</strong> test: she steered with her <em>elbows</em> while texting and then with her <em>legs</em> while putting on make-up.</p>
