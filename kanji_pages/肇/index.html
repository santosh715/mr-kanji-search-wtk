<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 17-1-2009(27): <strong>Founding</strong> of a nation is usually done by the taskmasters in charge behind closed doors. They sign some papers with their writing brushes and voila..</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 10-3-2010(6): Everyone seems to think that the<strong> Founding</strong> Fathers of the United States (the ones who signed the Declaration of Independence) were doing it out of their own free will. Truth is, George Washington, that hard old <em>taskmaster</em>, wouldn't let people out the <em>door</em> of the Pennsylvania State House until they had signed their name, and passed on the <em>writing brush</em> to the next person.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(2): After the<strong> founding</strong> of Post Secret, people started to <em>disclose</em> things with a <em>brush</em> instead of their mouths.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 22-7-2010(1): The<strong> FOUNDING</strong> of the correction facility is commemorated , right by the <em>DOOR</em> of the <em>TASKMASTER</em>'s office, with fine <em>BRUSH</em> calligraphy.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/danie115">danie115</a>] 21-12-2008(1): Before<strong> founding</strong> mcdonalds, we had to torture behind closed doors ronald to sign (with a writing brush) over the burgers See <a href="../v4/1085.html">disclose</a> (#1085 啓).</p>
