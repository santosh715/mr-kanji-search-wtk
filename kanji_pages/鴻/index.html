<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-2-2007(45): A <em>bird</em> often found near <em>creeks</em> is the<strong> large goose</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 10-8-2008(6): This is a<strong> large goose</strong> that has flown into a <em>craft</em> area - aka a construction site. It flies in and sits in a small pond of <em>water</em> and makes itself at home. The construction workers are about to get rid of it when they notice that it makes some really, really terrible honking noises - as a matter of fact, those noises sound just like construction work. They realize that if they keep the<strong> large goose</strong> around, they can take breaks without their boss realizing!</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 25-2-2007(1): A lady I know has this character in her last name so I'm going to think of her as <strong>mother goose</strong>. When I'm up the <em>creek</em> I call this old <em>bird</em> to come and do a bit of translation for me.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 3-1-2007(1): This<strong> large goose</strong> is a <em>bird</em> who is very <em>crafty</em> in finding food in the <em>water</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 20-1-2011(): If you see a <em>bird</em> down by the <em>creek</em>, it is probably a<strong> large goose</strong>.</p>
