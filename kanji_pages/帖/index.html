<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-10-2007(55): The <em>fortune teller</em> tells me that in the future I will have my own<strong> quire</strong>. "Is that choir as in 'group of singers', or<strong> quire</strong> as in 'sheets of paper'?" I ask. She can't tell because her crystal ball is too misty, so I rush to the bathroom, grab a <em>towel</em>, and use it to wipe the crystal ball. Turns out to be<strong> quire</strong> as in 'sheets of paper', of course.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kusterdu">kusterdu</a>] 20-9-2008(37): (25 sheets of paper) – the fortune teller orders a<strong> quire</strong> of paper but receives a<strong> quire</strong> of towels. She calls to complain, but customer service tells her, "Why didn't you see it coming?".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 11-11-2006(5): A<strong> quire</strong> in English means a set of 24 sheets of paper. In Japanese, it means 25 sheets. Well, rumor has it this is because on the 24 sheets needs to a <em>towel</em> (the 25th sheet), to ward off evil spirits, according to a famous <em>fortuneteller</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 2-8-2010(4): They put a <em>towel</em> over the <em>fortune teller</em>'s head and had her guess how many pieces of paper were in each<strong> quire</strong> in front of her. "How many in this<strong> quire</strong> of rice paper?" "Twenty." Amazing! "How many in this<strong> quire</strong> of nori?" "Ten." Wow! - (Note: "Quire" means a collection of 24 or 25 sheets of paper, but this kanji is actually used as a counter for bundles of several types of paper-like objects, and the amount in one bundle differs for each object (1<strong> quire</strong> of rice paper = 20 sheets, nori = 10 sheets, etc.)).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 24-1-2011(2): If there is a <em>towel</em> and written on it is "quire", then you don't need a <em>fortune teller</em> to tell you that there are 25 sheets of paper in it.</p>
