<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 27-6-2009(24): I gave the <em>angel</em> a <em>flower</em>. In return she gifted me with a year's supply of<strong> buckwheat</strong> to feed my family.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 27-5-2007(22): "Buckwheat's been shot!<strong> Buckwheat</strong>'s been shot!" At his funeral, attended by the rest of Our Gang,<strong> Buckwheat</strong> is placed in his coffin covered by flowers. An angel is also present, and says "Its O-tay<strong> Buckwheat</strong>, you have been invited up to heaven!".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 8-3-2007(14): Grain from the<strong> buckwheat</strong> <em>plant</em> can be used for some <em>angelically</em> tasting cakes.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 2-4-2009(6): The buck-toothed <em>angel</em> pulls a <em>flower</em> through her buck teeth thereby removing all the flowers and leaves. The stems that remain are then processed into<strong> buckwheat</strong> noodles.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 22-2-2010(3): 年越し蕎麦 (としこしそば) is a dish of<strong> buckwheat</strong> noodles eaten on New Year's Eve to promote longevity. In other words, to prevent you meeting those <em>angels</em> (imagine them with <em>flowers</em> in their hair) before your time.</p>
