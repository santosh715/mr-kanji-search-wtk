<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 14-8-2006(62): "Please <em>stop and sit down</em> to look to the painting up there", the tour guide says. "We don't know exactly who is on the painting, but from the <em>shape</em> of the <em>hair</em> and the distinctive <em>beard</em>, we think they meant to depict President Lincoln.".</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora">Yozora</a>] 21-9-2009(23): A<strong> beard</strong> is hair that, instead of wanting it SHAPED like your friends, you grow it LONG so that you can STOP, SIT DOWN and scratch it thoughtful while considering this here and that there.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 7-7-2008(12): If you remember hair on the head is 髪 . But when my mother sees the state of my<strong> beard</strong>, she says, "What is <em>this</em>!?".</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shingo">Shingo</a>] 7-9-2010(5): The hair that you shape (with your hand) when you stop and sit down is your<strong> beard</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch">NeoGlitch</a>] 19-1-2012(4): I was eating my soup when I saw a <em>hair</em>y <em>shape</em> in it. I <em>stop</em>ped my <em>spoon</em> immediately, and yelled outraged "What's <em>this here</em>?!! Then the cook arrived and said: "Oh, that's my detachable<strong> beard</strong>… sorry, my bad :(" (+jabberwockychortles).</p>
