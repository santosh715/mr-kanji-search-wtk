<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 2-10-2006(51): My mother used to joke that if I didn't wash my <em>ears</em> properly,<strong> mushroom</strong> <em>plants</em> would be growing out of them.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 30-6-2009(10): I took <strong>mushrooms</strong> and saw <em>flowers</em> sprouting from my friend's <em>ears</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum">oregum</a>] 22-12-2011(1): After eating too many<strong> MUSHROOM</strong>S I stuck FLOWERS in my EARS and ran around yelling that I am going to save the planet.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345">gfb345</a>] 18-4-2010(1): The common names of many<strong> MUSHROOM</strong> species attest to how they were often perceived as the <em>VEGETATION</em>'s <em>EAR</em>s: wood <em>EAR</em>, tree <em>EAR</em>, etc. (Following DeRoo, here I'm extending the <em>FLOWER</em> primitive to <em>VEGETATION/VEGETAL/VEGETABLE</em>; this extension is useful for other kanji as well.).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 25-2-2010(1): It's well known that<strong> mushroom</strong>s are not <em>flower</em>ing plants. Less well known is a<strong> mushroom</strong> known as the "Jew's ear". It really looks like an <em>ear</em>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File</a>:Auricularia_auricula-judae_a.JPG shows an example.</p>
