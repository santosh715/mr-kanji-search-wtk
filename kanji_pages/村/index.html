<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zhangqiezi">zhangqiezi</a>] 29-5-2008(230): If you've ever played an old 8 bit or 16 bit RPG, like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy or Inindou, you'll remember that every <em>town</em> was all bordered off by a line of <em>trees</em> with no space in between to get out through. Imagine that the trees were <em>glued together</em> so you could only exit<strong> town</strong> through the main or side gates, (so you couldn't escape the important scripted scenes.).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 3-4-2009(162): Pfft. At it's core, a<strong> town</strong> is just a bunch of <em>wood</em> <em>glued</em> together. Edit - Stop starring this piece of crap story! xD.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sunday">Sunday</a>] 8-3-2008(65): There is a mix up, this kanji means むら=village, not<strong> town</strong>. The one for<strong> town</strong> is まち　= 町 . 100% shure because my teacher is native Japanese.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kieron">Kieron</a>] 3-7-2007(57): I swap the <em>town/village</em> keywords. See also <a href="../v4/92.html">village</a> (#92 町). As the old Siberian joke went, there's nothing to do in a small rural <strong>village</strong> but count (<em>measure</em>) the <em>trees</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MikeNeko">MikeNeko</a>] 21-6-2008(48): 村 means village! See <a href="../v4/92.html">village</a> (#92 町). Please don't get them confused like Heisig seems to have done. Story: See the <em>tree</em>s surround the little <strong>village</strong> so densely it looks like they are <em>glued</em> together. Imagine a little village on a hillside surrounded by trees with glue dripping off the trees.</p>
