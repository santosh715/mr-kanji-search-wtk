<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei">javiergakusei</a>] 18-9-2007(246): Two cowboys are crossing a state limit. One says to him “Did you know that in this<strong> Jurisdiction</strong> there are Orders to get your head?”, so he takes out his gun and shoots him. He claims the reward afterwards. (Thanks Fuaburisu).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phauna">phauna</a>] 19-2-2008(97): <em>Orders</em> are given by the <em>head</em> person in any<strong> jurisdiction</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lerris">lerris</a>] 4-7-2007(31): <em>President Bush</em>, with his swelled <em>head</em>, thinks everything is under his<strong> jurisdiction</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Talka">Talka</a>] 10-9-2007(23): You're outside of your<strong> jurisdiction</strong>, Johnson! Show me your orders or I'll have your head.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 22-5-2006(17): <strong>Jurisdiction</strong> just makes me think of "sheriff". So my story takes place in the<strong> jurisdiction</strong> of some sheriff. The sheriff goes into a bar and calls the waitress. He looks at one of those "WANTED" posters, with the portrait of a criminal he's been trying to catch for such a long time. When asked for his <em>orders</em>, still staring intently at the picture, he says : "I want the <em>head</em> of that guy on a plate, yep, right now!". The waitress scurried away and brought him just that : <em>orders</em> with a <em>head</em>.</p>
