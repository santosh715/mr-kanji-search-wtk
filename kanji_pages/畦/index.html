<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(27): <em>Ivy</em> grows on the<strong> paddy-field ridge</strong> encircling the <em>rice field</em> as opposed to the intra-field paddy ridge that divides it in half.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 23-1-2010(16): [+mantixen] The ordinary 畔 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1204">paddy-ridge</a> (#1204 畔) dissects the <em>field</em> by dividing it in <em>half</em>, but the<strong> paddy-field ridge</strong> runs around the outside &amp; is covered in <em>ivy</em>. Disambiguate by noting that the hyphen in 'paddy-ridge' divides the word itself in <em>half</em> (five letters each side) but 'paddy-field ridge' has five extra letters on the right, the ridge itself, in fact, the part covered in <em>ivy</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 4-8-2008(3): This<strong> paddy-field ridge</strong> separates two paddy fields. The reason for it being made of <em>ivy</em> is a bit pathetic, but necessary - it turns out that the two neighboring paddy field owners got in a bit of a fight over whose paddy field irrigation system was the best. Then both of them started insulting the others' systems, saying that they didn't want the others' dirty water in their field. So they put <em>ivy</em> up between it, which sucks up all the water from the edges (which is why there is none).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 8-11-2010(2): 畦道 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2571">paddy-field ridge</a> (#2571 畦) (ケイ), あぜ … Parts: 田 , 圭 … Note: 圭 often means demarcation. … Similar Keywords: あぜ both 畔 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1204">paddy-ridge</a> (#1204 畔), and 畦 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2571">paddy-field ridge</a> (#2571 畦) ..1. 畔道 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1204">paddy-ridge</a> (#1204 畔) is a phrase divided in half. A rice field is divided in half, half is field half is water. If you stand at the halfway mark, you are at the <em>Waterside</em> ..2. 畦道 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2571">paddy-field ridge</a> (#2571 畦) is not equally divisible in half, because piled with ivy. ..3. The Rice Field comedy tour, leaving them in Stitches, follows the 畷 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2072">rice-field footpath</a> (#2072 畷).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 6-8-2009(1): An improvement from the regular paddy ridge, the<strong> paddy-field ridge</strong> is surrounded by ivy.</p>
