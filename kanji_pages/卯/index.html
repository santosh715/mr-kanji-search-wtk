<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb">johnskb</a>] 25-5-2006(126): You know how missing childrens' pictures often appear on milk cartons? Well here we have a missing hare. His concerned family is having his picture printed on the backs of receipts and even on stamps. So far, however, there has been no<strong> SIGN OF THE HARE</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 8-11-2007(118): <em>rabbit ears</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 10-9-2007(65): Identical to <em>egg</em>, without the "yolks." Both hares and eggs are used for Spring celebrations because they are symbols of fertility.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey">TheSlakey</a>] 8-1-2009(48): The<strong> sign of the hare</strong> is an Easter Bunny, with it's eggs that have no yoke (instead, they have candy).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 6-7-2006(9): In this version of the story of the "Turtle and Rabbit Run a Race", the rabbit stops on his way to a shop where they sell <em>stamps</em>, just meters away from the finishing line. In the shop, the rabbit quickly forgets about time and spends hours looking at stamps, finally after choosing a good hundred <em>stamps</em> to buy, he receives a very long <em>receipt</em>, and pays for them. He leaves the shop with stamps in one hand and the receipt in the other, and you guessed it… the turle won the race.</p>
