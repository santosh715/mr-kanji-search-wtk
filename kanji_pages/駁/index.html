<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 9-3-2009(21): <em>Wolverine</em>'s had charges placed on him for murdering a <em>horse</em>, but he make's a<strong> rebuttal</strong> stating that he couldn't have been in two different places at the same time (i.e. There cannot exist <em>two Wolverines</em>). He was having dinner with his Aunt Margaret at the time, it's impossible.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 5-6-2008(8): Trojan horse, 2 sheafs: Proponents of taking the <em>Trojan Horse</em> into the city employed convincing arguments in their<strong> rebuttal</strong>. They put <em>2 sheafs</em> next to the <em>Trojan Horse</em> and put them on fire. 'You see, if it were a trap, and enemies were inside, they would surely come out right now.' However, during the<strong> rebuttal</strong>, nobody noticed the caughing coming from inside the <em>Trojan Horse</em>….</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 30-7-2009(6): <em>Wolverine</em> gave a<strong> rebuttal</strong> that the <em>slash marks</em> on the <em>horse</em> didn't even look like his.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 30-7-2010(2): <a href="Http://www.break.com/index/horse-kicks-moron-in-the-face.html">Http://www.break.com/index/horse-kicks-moron-in-the-face.html</a> some<strong> rebuttal</strong>… those two <em>X</em>es are marks from where the <em>horse</em> hit the moron.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 15-1-2010(2): Just like<strong> REBUTTAL</strong>s that go on endlessly, a HORSE that's placed at an equal distance from TWO SHEAVES of hay will go on endlessly trying to make up its mind which one to eat.</p>
