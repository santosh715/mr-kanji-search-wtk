<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 8-1-2007(54): An ancient Japanese<strong> dragon</strong>, beautiful and terrifying. Here it is depicted standing on a piece of meat (its prey) and a description is written on the right margin. It is said to be like a snake that has three toes on its feet and can sometimes use its head as a flamethrower (kind of like a sling, but with fire instead of stones). (Note: The Japanese<strong> dragon</strong> has three toes, unlike other Asian<strong> dragon</strong>s. Asian<strong> dragon</strong>s generally don't breath fire, but Godzilla does, and it is supposed to be a<strong> dragon</strong>!).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun">shakkun</a>] 2-7-2008(29): (insp by raulir) The ancient Japanese<strong> Dragon</strong>, now extinct, is depicted in a book of lore STANDING on a pile of freshly slaughtered MEAT. The column describes how the last Japanese<strong> Dragon</strong> was killed by a party of adventurers, who struck its SNAKE body simultaneously with a SLINGSHOT and THREE swords.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 9-9-2008(9): The <strong>old<strong> dragon</strong></strong> places a <em>vase</em> on top of the <em>moon</em> for target practice and then tries to hit it using his special <em>slingshot</em> made from a <em>snake</em>. It takes him <em>three</em> shots: "Missed… missed… Got it!" (Note <em>slingshot</em> &amp; <em>snake</em> share one stroke).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howtwosavealif3">howtwosavealif3</a>] 5-2-2011(5): 立 月 ト コ ひんまげ チョンチョンチョン → 龍 .</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Crowfoot">Crowfoot</a>] 27-4-2008(4): First the young<strong> dragon</strong>s <em>attacked</em> the old<strong> dragon</strong> to dethrone him, then they removed his <em>garments</em> as a way of humiliation.</p>
