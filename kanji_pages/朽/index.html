<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/volfy">volfy</a>] 4-4-2006(159): This <em>snare</em> isn't terribly effective, because it's swinging from a<strong> decay</strong>ing <em>tree</em>. Imagine the tree as being so<strong> decay</strong>ed that when an animal gets caught in the snare, its struggles cause the tree to collapse into a putrid mess.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 14-9-2007(74): [+air,charley] Trigger: <strong>decaying</strong> remains. You walk by a tree and see the <strong>decaying</strong> remains of what looks like a dead human (? hard to tell, it's been years), still trapped in a <em>bear trap</em>. Turns out that the tree itself set them out. All of its comrades were getting chopped down, so it puts out <em>bear traps</em> to en<em>snare</em> would-be choppers and lets them simply<strong> decay</strong>, and uses their remains as nutrients.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/richcoop">richcoop</a>] 3-7-2009(56): 枯 wither The<strong> decay</strong> of an animal in the TREE was from something caught in a SNARE.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Floatingweed5">Floatingweed5</a>] 8-10-2007(30): Don't use wooden snares because, as the woodsman says, "They're prone to<strong> decay</strong>, and the catch gets away".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 10-7-2006(24): <strong>Tree</strong> doesn't like getting chopped. To protect himself, he's set up a <strong>snare</strong> beside him. If anybody comes to chop him down, they'll get en<strong>snare</strong>d, and he'll just let them <em>decay</em> into nutrients that <strong>Tree</strong> will consume.</p>
