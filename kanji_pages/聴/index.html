<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 26-2-2008(250): I promise to use my <em>ear</em> to do nothing but<strong> listen</strong> … stick a <em>needle</em> in my <em>eye</em>, cross my <em>heart</em> and hope to die! (Intentionally said backwards to get the order of the primitives correct).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 14-8-2006(115): <strong>Listen</strong>ing to others is different from hearing [1626] with the <em>ear</em>. One must allow the words to pierce through the <em>eyes</em> (the window of the soul) and reach deep into the <em>heart</em>…a symbol of thinking about and contemplating on what was said, not just the sounds of words spoken. A married man while reading his newspaper, his wife going on about something suddenly, says, "You're not<strong> listen</strong>ing to me, are you?" He replies, "I heard every word you said. You said…" “Yes, but you're not<strong> listen</strong>ing.".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 25-1-2006(48): A doctor is<strong> listen</strong>ing as best as he can to someone's heart, but even with the stethoscope the doctor can not hear anything, because the patient's heart is "so small it could pass through the eye of a needle" (see frame 400). Contrast with passive "hear" of frame 1626.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jwy2k2">jwy2k2</a>] 10-4-2007(44): When you really<strong> listen</strong> to another person and not just hear them, you use your ears like ten eyes and see their heartfelt meaning.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vertigo959">vertigo959</a>] 24-9-2008(24): To detect lies, <em>Darth Vader</em> turns up his <em>ear</em> piece loud enough so that he can hear someone's <em>heart</em> beat, and closely<strong> listen</strong>s. チョウ <a href="midori://search?text=聴覚、聴講、聴診器。">聴覚、聴講、聴診器。</a> .</p>
