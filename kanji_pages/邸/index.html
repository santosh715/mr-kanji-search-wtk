<h2>Reading:</h2>

<h3>On-Yomi: <a>テイ</a> — Kun-Yomi: <a>やしき</a></h3>


	
    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>city walls On the left, and rather more pressed in its form, this element meant the high spot of a village, or its pinnacle. On the right side, in the form shown here, it means the lowest part of the city, around which its walls rise up as a protection against invaders. Hence we nickname this element: city walls.

<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/QuackingShoe">QuackingShoe</a>] 22-7-2008(151): So fed up am I, I've finally built <em>city walls</em> around my<strong> residence</strong> to keep these Japanese from soliciting me with their <em>business cards</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry">Perry</a>] 28-4-2010(87): The <em>business card</em> says his<strong> residence</strong> is just to the left of the <em>city walls</em>. Can you find it? Yep, got it.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scotty28">scotty28</a>] 2-8-2009(85): Suggestion- since we have the pinnacle on the left(which had a great potential for imaginative stories as we explored the ultimate society), the right side will be the pinnacle's opposite - the slum. It's so dangerous that a steep menacing city wall has been erected to keep its denizens in(and protect those outside). story: If your calling card said your<strong> residence</strong> was the slum, you'd be too ashamed to show it to anyone.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt">adrianbarritt</a>] 28-8-2007(45): There are so many places of<strong> residence</strong> inside the city walls, I put a calling card outside mine so I can find my way home.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 18-1-2009(12): My <em>business card</em> shows that my<strong> residence</strong> is within the <em>city walls</em>.</p>
