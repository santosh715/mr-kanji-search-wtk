<h2 id="koohii-stories">Koohii stories:</h2>

<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 16-2-2008(28): Mr. T was selected to head up the committee studying the<strong> Yamato</strong> period.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 13-10-2007(21): There's always a <em>person</em> named<strong> Yamato</strong> on every <em>committee</em>. And I always hate them.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 14-7-2009(12): This kanji was originally used as the Chinese word for Japan, and its etymological meaning is that of a "supplicating people". In the 8th century the use of this kanji to describe Japan (read as "Wa" or "Yamato") was changed to the kanji for <a href="../v4/897.html">harmony</a> (#897 和), which was popular because the Japanese liked to believe that their society was based on harmony (not on being submissive and dominable as this kanji suggests). Story: <em>Dad</em> joined the<strong> Yamato</strong> <em>committee</em> to foster international cooperation.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 28-3-2009(4): "And here's <em>Mr. Yama</em><strong>Tee</strong>, head of the spelling and pronunciation <em>Commi</em><strong>Tee</strong>".</p>
