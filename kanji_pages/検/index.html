<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ergerg">ergerg</a>] 15-1-2007(158): You're giving a TREE an<strong> EXAMINATION</strong>. You take a wood sample from the TREE with an AWL (cmp <a href="../v4/1278.html">exam</a> (#1278 校)).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 4-2-2008(112): Don't confuse with <a href="../v4/1278.html">exam</a> (#1278 校), <a href="../v4/354.html">test</a> (#354 試), <a href="../v4/1487.html">evaluate</a> (#1487 評). Think of<strong> examination</strong> as a doctor's<strong> examination</strong>. You're having problems getting <em>wood</em> in bed. You go in for a doctor's<strong> examination</strong>. The doctor shoves an <em>icepick</em> into your manhood as part of the<strong> examination</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 23-2-2008(50): After intense cross-<strong>examination</strong> from the prosecutor, the <em>tree</em> confessed to murdering the <em>wood</em>-pecker with an <em>awl</em>… "He just kept at it, he kept poking at me with that beak, so I thought I'd see how HE liked it!!" The autopsy<strong> examination</strong> revealed at least a dozen puncture wounds, what a brutal case.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kioku3">kioku3</a>] 13-1-2009(25): The doctor gives a physical<strong> examination</strong> to <em>Frankenstein's Monster.</em> The monster is so big the doctor has to use a <em>tree</em> to hit his knee and check his reflexes. (I am using astridtops' primitive of <em>Frankenstein's Monster</em> (fit (together) and person) in place of "awl").</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 12-6-2007(17): Patient goes to see the doctor for an<strong> examination</strong>. he says "Everytime i walk i fart". Doc asks him to take a few steps and he farts constantly. Docs puzzled and has never seen this before. He asks him to repeat and it happens again. So the doc tells him to go to the examinatino area and take his pants off. He then gets out a giant wooden awl slightly hooked at the end. What the f*<em>k are you going to do with that!? asks teh patient. "Open the windows, it f</em>cking stinks in here!" replies the doc.</p>
