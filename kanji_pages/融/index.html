<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zenkun">zenkun</a>] 13-3-2006(653): I have created the element "old camera" out of the left side of the kanji: from the subject's point of view, the light is captured by <em>one</em> <em>mouth</em> (the lens). The photographer is under a big <em>hood</em>, we only see his <em>legs</em>, and he is holding a <em>spike</em> in his right hand, which is the shutter release. Now, at the time the photographer takes the photo, a little <em>insect</em> is flying near the flash. The flash is so powerful that the insect is burnt and<strong> dissolve</strong>s in the air.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas">amthomas</a>] 21-3-2007(97): I've seen this crazy thing with only <em>one mouth</em> that can<strong> dissolve</strong> up to <em>4 nails</em> and an <em>insect</em> at the same time. Sweet! (It's a venus flytrap, btw).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 27-11-2008(42): Just one single mouthful of cola has enough acidic power to<strong> dissolve</strong> 4 nails and one large live insect! Gross! (Not actually true, but meh…).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xiaoma">xiaoma</a>] 29-9-2009(28): 鬲 is a "reki" <a href="http://images.google.com/images?oe=utf-8&amp;q=%E9%AC%B2">http://images.google.com/images?oe=utf-8&amp;q=%E9%AC%B2</a> Its <em>mouth</em> faces the <em>ceiling</em>, it's hooded, and it's got three legs. My magical <em>reki</em> has 2 <em>animal legs</em> in front and a <em>spike</em> in the back. It can <em>dissolve</em> any <em>insect</em> that dares pass between its mouth and the ceiling. My reki can also<strong> dissolve</strong> website designers who <em>bug</em> it by not allowing HTML links.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 24-10-2005(24): <strong>Dissolve</strong> (fuse, liquefied by heat) a man is welding a large hole in the <em>ceiling</em>. He sees his wife's <em>mouth</em> yelling at him from the floor above, but he can't hear her from inside the welding <em>helmet</em>. He steps back with his tiny <em>legs</em> onto a <em>nail</em> (ouch), all while a huge nasty stinging <em>insect</em> gets into his helmet. This guy is just having one of those days. :) <em>(This one is an abridged version of Fuaburisu, but I posted it because this kanji is so damn hard to remember by a story)</em>.</p>
