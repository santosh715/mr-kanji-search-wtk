<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 27-7-2009(67): The <em>king</em> used <em>both hands</em> to<strong> tinker with</strong> himself in his spare time.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 12-6-2007(20): Picture the king holding a large pan in his two hands and tinkering with it, wishing he could lead the itinerant life of a tinker. As a rhyme: The <em>king</em>, he uses his <em>two hands</em>, To<strong> tinker with</strong> his pots and pans . . .</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama">MeisterLlama</a>] 9-11-2009(15): Tinker seems to imply mending or working at something, which is wrong. This is more like "to trifle with". (The meaning of "to trifle with" is sufficiently different from "trifle" that there should be no confusion). The king can trifle with anything using his two hands (be it objects, his subjects, or himself).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 21-11-2008(7): When something new is invented, the king is always the first to be able to<strong> tinker with</strong> it. So picture yourself looking up at the <em>king</em> with <em>both hands</em> holding your new invention, only to have it <strong>tinkered with</strong> and broken by the king who would say nothing more than "oh dear".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 10-4-2007(5): The <em>king</em> wore jewels on <em>both hands</em> that had been <strong>tinkered with</strong> so that they contained poison.</p>
