<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 13-6-2008(137): I'm going to<strong> visit</strong> my grandpa in the hospital. He broke his <em>elbow</em>, and it became really <em>big</em> and contorted into a weird <em>shape</em>. I hope he will be all right!</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 22-3-2006(89): Whenever the postman has to pay a<strong> visit</strong> to this place, he brings an elbow-shaped thingy that he throws to the St. Bernard.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Green_Airplane">Green_Airplane</a>] 7-8-2008(43): I paid a<strong> visit</strong> to my neighbour, but I forgot he had this huge <em>St. Bernard dog</em>. The doctor said my <em>elbow</em> will never be the same <em>shape</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart">cbogart</a>] 22-2-2007(33): I was a little nonplussed by the inappropriateness of this keyword, so I decided to use "the three kings" instead; they are a threesome, and they make a religiously-motivated<strong> visit</strong>, right? Anyway, they travel by night, so they're just these three shapes moving through the gloom. They can't see well, so a St. Bernard dog noses their elbows whenever they start to go the wrong way.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 19-3-2008(32): Hint: This is the humble/old kanji of the verb "to go/to come", and also is the kanji for "three" on legal documents. I suggest using the "three musketeers" for this primitive, raising their three blades with the elbow. (the elbow primitive could be viewed as a pictograph of the musketeer's hat, with a feather on the side, too).</p>
