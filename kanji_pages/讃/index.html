<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 1-7-2007(42): <strong>Compliment</strong>s are <em>words</em> of <em>approval</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 24-7-2007(6): The <em>words</em> spoken between the <em>two husbands</em> who <em>approve</em> of how each spends their wife's hard earned <em>money</em> are nothing but <strong>compliments</strong>. "Good job old chap!" "A fine car you purchased on her credit!" "What nice designer pants, won't she be miffed!".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin">Aerin</a>] 24-4-2008(1): When someone <em>approves</em> of your work, they<strong> compliment</strong> you with <em>words</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 26-7-2010(): As you pass by, you can hear the <em>words</em> from the <em>gay couple</em> (two husbands), one giving <strong>compliments</strong> to the others about his deliciously <em>oyster</em> (shellfish) dinner. Then you pick up the pace, and before you leave you give them your final <em>word</em> on the issue: "God does not <em>approve</em> homosexuality".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/perrin4869">perrin4869</a>] 13-9-2010(): As the husband was taken away by his wife in frame <a href="../v4/843.html">approve</a> (#843 賛), he <strong>complimented</strong> her on her good looks (with <em>words</em>, of course) in a desperate attempt to make her leave him and complete the exchange. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether it worked or not.</p>
