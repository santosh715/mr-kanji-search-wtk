<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 10-3-2008(226): For Japanese, when the mind's eye (the sideways eye) feels guilty for something bad that the body has done, there are two<strong> penalty</strong>s to choose from. One, you can say I'm sorry. Two, you can commit suicide by sabre. Why, oh why, do so many Japanese executives commit suicide at the first sign of scandal when all the have to do is say I'm sorry to get off the hook. (on yomi: バチ, バツ).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Proxx">Proxx</a>] 13-9-2007(108): There is a 3-way masterplan for every goalkeeper to prevent a goal at<strong> penalty</strong> shootout: 1. Look directly into the <em>eyes</em> of the player — 2. Confuse him by screaming senseless <em>words</em> — 3. Pull out you your <em>saber</em> and … (that's up to you).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 27-12-2007(56): This keyword must be kept separate from "penal" and "punishment". I use the game-specific meaning of "penalty". Imagine a game of scrabble with a mechanical, computerized surveillance camera (the all-seeing EYE) as the game master, monitoring what the players do. If a scrabble player tries to form a WORD that is not in the robot's dictionary, that player is immediately hit with a<strong> PENALTY</strong>, and the robot uses his robotic arm to automatically injure the offending player with a SABER.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix">kaminix</a>] 10-8-2008(48): This kanji is a timeline. First we have the <em>eye</em> wittness observing the crime, then we have the prosectuor <em>talking</em> about the crime in court, finally we have the guilty being <strong>penalised</strong> for his crimes. Eye to words to action.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly">uchifly</a>] 17-2-2010(38): (Seppuku) The greatest<strong> PENALTY</strong> in Japan: You close your EYEs, say your last WORDS, put the SABER in…</p>
