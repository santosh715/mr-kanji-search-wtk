<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 15-6-2007(519): The<strong> rice plant</strong> is common in Japan because all the <em>wheat</em> was eaten by <em>vultures</em> in the <em>olden times</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian">smithsonian</a>] 4-3-2007(44): It used to be that <em>wheat</em> was grown in Japan. However, this was often stolen by <em>vultures</em>, so in <em>olden times</em>, the gods gave the Japanese the<strong> rice plant</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/altape">altape</a>] 2-1-2008(20): The<strong> rice plant</strong> evolved from wheat in olden times to defend itself against vultures eating it - rice causes vultures to explode.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rooboy">Rooboy</a>] 1-4-2009(10): Wheat has been trying to claw its way in to japan since olden times but the<strong> rice plant</strong> still domiantes the landscape.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow">Harrow</a>] 9-12-2008(8): What we are calling wheat really refers to a<strong> rice plant</strong>, known to Wolverine from olden times (Wolverine is a lot older than he looks – he was born in the 1880s). Imagine Wolverine in ancient times (mukashi mukashi) planting rice by poking a little hole with his claws and then settling the plant into the mud.</p>
