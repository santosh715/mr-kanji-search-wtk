<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 31-1-2007(31): It really<strong> elude</strong>s me why we have two kanji with the same keyword… this one and <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1973">deviate/elude</a> (#1973 逸). But lets intertwine their stories: The rabbit, who<strong> elude</strong>d capture (<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1973">deviate/elude</a> (#1973 逸)) on the <em>road</em>, was finally caught when someone threw a <em>shield</em> over it.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/woelpad">woelpad</a>] 8-5-2008(14): The Spartan had to block the <em>road</em> to stop the advancing enemy army, but he tried to <strong>shirk</strong> his duty and threw away his <em>shield</em>. That's suicide.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 23-3-2010(10): With <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/1973">deviate/elude</a> (#1973 逸) already taken, Heisig changed the keyword for this one to <strong>shirk</strong> (= <strong>elude</strong> responsibility) in the 2nd edition. [from Corodon] STORY: Imagine a pre-battle speech, "Down that <em>road</em> lies the enemy, raise your <em>shields</em> and do not <strong>shirk</strong> (<strong>elude</strong> your responsibility)". You can imagine the rest… "If you find yourself alone… riding in green fields with the sun on your face. Do not be troubled… for you are in Elysium, and you're already dead!".</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 28-12-2009(6): Could fabrice change the damn keyword to <strong>shirk</strong> already?</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 12-4-2012(3): Roman legions used to form an impenetrable formation called the testudo, where their <em>shields</em> were held together like a tortoise's shell, protecting them from arrows and spears as they marched along the <em>road</em>. It was thus imperative that none of the soldiers <strong>shirk</strong> his duty, because if just one <em>shield</em> was not held firmly in place, flaming projectiles could enter and destroy the formation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File</a>:Testudo_formation.jpg.</p>
