<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 17-5-2008(61): This should be obvious, owners of prize race horse (STEEDS) are paid to have their<strong> STEED</strong> mate with another (hopefully to produce a prize winning foal). Yep, the<strong> STEED</strong>S are glorified HORSE HOOKERS.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 27-4-2008(22): Trojan horse, legal prostitute: The guy told the <em>legal prostitute</em> that he is like a <strong>steed</strong> in the bed and that she should do it for free. However, afterward - being severely disappointed- she considered him more like a <em>Trojan horse</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo">Shibo</a>] 13-7-2008(14): The <em>Trojan horse</em> approached a <em>legal prostitute</em>. "What a fine<strong> steed</strong>!", she exclaimed. "What I would not give to ride that animal!" The men inside were thinking about what they would not give to ride that lady. At the end of the evening, all were satisfied and the lady had made a year's wages in a day.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell">timcampbell</a>] 26-1-2008(6): The customer told the streetwalker that he was a real<strong> steed</strong> and he was going to work her over like a team of horses.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tryllid">tryllid</a>] 31-12-2010(3): Back when horses were called<strong> steed</strong>s, you just needed to own a <em>horse</em>, you didn't need a <em>license</em> to avoid using your <em>walking legs</em>.</p>
