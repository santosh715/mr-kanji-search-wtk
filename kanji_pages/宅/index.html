<h2>Reading:</h2>

<h3>On-Yomi: <a>タク</a> </h3>


	
    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>lock of hair This element is clearly derived from that for fur. By leaving out the second stroke, we get simply a lock of hair. [3]</p>
	

  	
    
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/naniwa">naniwa</a>] 18-3-2007(277): This kanji is, of course, pronounced "taku", and it seems the owner of this<strong> home</strong> is a little bit otaku himself. He has hung up <em>locks of hair</em> suruptitiously obtained from various females all over his <em>house</em>. A veritable hair fetishist, and certainly someone whose<strong> home</strong> you wouldn't want to visit.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Terhorst">Terhorst</a>] 13-2-2008(61): "<strong>Home</strong> is where the <em>hair</em> is".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken">Copycatken</a>] 29-6-2006(43): At<strong> home</strong>, all the drains in my <em>house</em> are clogged up with <em>locks of hair</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r">nest0r</a>] 16-4-2008(20): I'm very paranoid when I finally call my <em>house</em> a<strong> home</strong>, so whenever I leave, I cut a <em>lock of hair</em>, divide it into strands, and place it at all the entrances. If one is displaced, then I know someone has been there! Saw that in a James Bond movie.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3">thegeezer3</a>] 1-7-2007(16): House and locks of hair (goldilocks) = goldilocks broke into the bears house and treat it like her own<strong> home</strong> the selfish bitch.</p>
