<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Splatted">Splatted</a>] 8-6-2011(40): He quickly<strong> yank</strong>ed his <em>finger</em>s out of the <em>vase</em>. Maybe no one noticed the attempt to steal the cookies…</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 11-5-2010(16): As well as the meaning of 'taking captive', this also means 'crush' or 'batter'. One also often sees it written in Chinese, with the meaning "pull". (I think this is where 拉麺 comes from - 'drawn' or perhaps 'flattened' noodles.) My keyword is <strong>crush</strong> (I <strong>crushed</strong> my <em>fingers</em> trying to lift a heavy <em>vase</em>) but <strong>Ramen</strong> or the other common use for this kanji in Japanese, <strong>Latin</strong> (it's the abbreviation for the Latin language) would also be appropriate, as they help you learn the reading (ラ).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 17-1-2011(11): He<strong> yank</strong>ed his <em>finger</em> out of the <em>vase</em> upon discovering it had a venus fly trap in it.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 25-12-2009(8): <strong>kidnapper</strong>: The kidnapper wraps his fingers around the vase and then smashes it on the kid’s head. They carry him away. He’s been kidnapped.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dakoina">Dakoina</a>] 2-9-2010(5): RTK supplement: <strong>yank</strong>: I <em>yank</em>ed with my <em>fingers</em> at my car's steering wheel to avoid hitting someone who was standing in the middle of the road carying a Ming <em>vase</em>. I ended up against a light pole. I was hoping that Chinese would still be intact, but the person got scared and let it fall down… in pieces…</p>
