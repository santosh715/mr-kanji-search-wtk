<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-12-2008(34): In the old days, instead of having a micro-<em>computer</em> sewn into the suit of the master spy, a whole computer was carried in the<strong> back</strong> of his cloak, although it was clearly obvious that he was a spy. "What's that um.. enormous computer doing in the<strong> back</strong> your cloak?".</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 22-3-2010(3): Modern spy apparel includes microcomputers sown into the<strong> back</strong> of the top hat and scarf as seen in <a href="../v4/399.html">back</a> (#399 裏). However, in the <strong>old</strong> days, the coal driven <em>computer</em> was so bulky it had to be hidden in the<strong> back</strong> of a bulky <em>cloak</em>. All these old spies masqueraded as hunchbacks.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Meconium">Meconium</a>] 11-3-2010(1): The invisible man using the <em>computer</em> in <a href="../v4/399.html">back</a> (#399 裏) could also travel through time. All he had to say was, "I want to be <strong>back</strong> in the <strong>[old]</strong>en days!" and he would be instantly teleported<strong> back</strong> [old]. All that would be left was the <em>cloak</em> he was wearing; when he dematerialised, it fell down <em>beside the computer</em> in a heap.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 30-9-2007(1): Prior to donning a hat and cloak to protect his <strong>back</strong>, the evil cyborg simply kept a <em>cloak</em> to the side to protect his<strong> back</strong> [old].</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Panta">Panta</a>] 23-3-2013(): In the old days top hats weren't that popular (think capitalism), but on the other hand, cloaks were more popular than they are now.</p>
