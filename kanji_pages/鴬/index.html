<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(31): The<strong> nightingale</strong> is a <em>bird</em> that goes to a <em>schoolhouse</em> at night to learn to sing.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite">thecite</a>] 20-12-2009(10): This character is actually a 俗字 (unofficial simplification) of the character 鶯. As such, it is actually far less common than the traditional character according to a google search. Story for the correct character: The<strong> nightingale</strong> is bird with a crown (mane) as bright as a deep fire (two fires).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 3-12-2008(2): At the <em>school house</em> we all learnt about some <em>bird</em> named Florence<strong> Nightingale</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 8-6-2008(2): Schoolhouse, bird: The kids were trying to study in the <em>schoolhouse</em>, but an annoying <em>bird</em> which could sing beautifully - the<strong> nightingale</strong> - was disturbing class. So, teacher got out his shotgun and shot the damn <em>bird</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 18-3-2011(1): (a story that explains both the new and old version of the kanji) The <em>school house</em> burnt down twice in a row (<em>two fires</em>). Finally, the principal thought he had found the culprit. "But it wasn't it me!" said the kid. "It was a<strong> nightingale</strong>!" "Right kid… EXPELLED!" In the trees, a little <em>bird</em> was laughing.</p>
