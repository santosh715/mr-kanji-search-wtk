<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina">rgravina</a>] 1-6-2006(145): Your body <em>meat</em> is attached to the <em>bone joints</em> of your<strong> skeleton</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck">gavmck</a>] 27-11-2009(105): The top box 口 is the skull and the brain 田 has shriveled to the size of marble (but following kanji convention it is depicted as a square) and rolled into the bottom right hand corner. With all the hair and flesh gone the crown has slipped down to the shoulders like a necklace. 月 represents the rest of the body of the<strong> skeleton</strong>. [Idea for position of crown thanks to n1williams].</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Medialis">Medialis</a>] 23-3-2010(44): The most awesome pictograph ever: It's a guy going through an x-ray examination. The crown primitive depicts a glowing power field that goes from the top of this head down to the floor, progressively revealing his <em>skeleton</em>. Now, it's at the position of his shoulders, so everything below it is still <em>flesh</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 5-3-2009(25): Imagine a king who died on his throne and was never removed. Since his<strong> SKELETON</strong> has no hair, ears, etc, the CROWN has slipped down past several bone JOINTS and rests amid other PARTS OF his BODY.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 26-6-2007(22): Imagine a<strong> skeleton</strong> wearing a <em>crown</em> and with <em>flesh</em> on just its <em>bone joints</em>. What a strange<strong> skeleton</strong>…</p>
