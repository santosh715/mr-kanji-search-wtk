<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu">Raichu</a>] 29-10-2006(245): A<strong> depression</strong> is a hole in the ground. Water naturally collects there which provides moisture for vines to grow.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot">stefanot</a>] 30-3-2007(113): The<strong> depression</strong> in the ground become a trap: the <em>hole</em> was filled with <em>water</em> and covered with <em>ivy</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 29-8-2006(35): The meaning of this character is an indentation in the ground, not emotional<strong> depression</strong>. It's best to avoid using the latter in your story because it will give you the wrong meaning (keep in mind the eventual goal is to read kanji and understand the actual meaning of them). This particular<strong> depression</strong> is a <em>hole</em> in the ground that collects water, and ivy is growing out of it.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame">harusame</a>] 24-6-2009(16): (<strong>WARNING</strong>: Sexual content) Being the dirty girl that she is, I came upon <em>Paris Hilton</em> having sex in a<strong> depression</strong>, or <em>hole</em>, in the ground. At this point, however, she and her unfortunately partner were tangled up in some <em>ivy</em> and couldn't get out. So I filled it with <em>water</em> and watched them both drown.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/coinbaahd">coinbaahd</a>] 20-11-2011(7): This kanji reminds me of video games. There's a big <em>sink hole</em> in the ground that is now filled with <em>water</em> that you can swim in and <em>vines</em> growing all around that you can climb on.</p>
