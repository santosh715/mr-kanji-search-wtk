<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 12-1-2007(299): A fine <em>mist</em> is falling, and so everyone gathers around near the<strong> tree-trunk</strong>, effectively using the rest of the tree as an <em>umbrella</em> in order to keep <em>dry</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 10-5-2007(64): By astridtops - In the rainy <em>mist</em>, Totoro is standing in front of a<strong> tree-trunk</strong> at the bus stop, under the <em>umbrella</em> he just received. Look at him smiling: even when the big drops fall, he remains <em>dry</em>! Great story…which I get to by thinking:<strong> tree-trunk</strong>-&gt;<strong>TT</strong> -&gt;<strong>T</strong>onari no <strong>T</strong>otoro. I also imagine Mickey Mouse is there too as the KUNyomi for this kanji is みき.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35">usis35</a>] 8-10-2009(22): The word that you will sure see with this kanji is shinkansen (bullet train). 新幹線 . STORY: Shinkansen is very expensive, so I only use it when a MIST is falling. I prefer the train than an UMBRELLA to stay DRY.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 6-2-2008(20): There is no tree in this kanji! So think of a cold, bare, dead<strong> tree-trunk</strong>, with the upper branches all cut off. Residents of the neighboring house have run a <em>clothesline</em> from their window to the dead<strong> tree-trunk</strong>. You are filled with sadness, seeing the greatness of nature being destroyed and exploited by mankind. You are walking by this sad scene on a cold and drizzly day with a fine <em>mist</em> descending, using an <em>umbrella</em> to keep yourself <em>dry</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 22-7-2006(12): In the rainy <em>mist</em>, Totoro is standing in front of a<strong> tree-trunk</strong> at the bus stop, under the <em>umbrella</em> he just received. Look at him smiling: even when the big drops fall, he remains <em>dry</em>!</p>
