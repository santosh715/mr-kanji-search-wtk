    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>golden calf The story is told of the people of the Exodus that, in their distrust of Moses’ leadership, they gathered together and melted down their gold ornaments to fashion a golden calf for an idol. The animal horns and heavens here represent that god of theirs. [6]</p>
	

  	
    
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 16-3-2007(188): After worshipping the <em>golden calf</em>, God sent the Jews on a long <em>road</em> through the wilderness.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 28-3-2008(92): The problem with the "gold calf" primitive is that the first vertical stroke of "heavenly" is shorter than the second stroke. But as we know, "heavenly" clearly has the FIRST stroke longer, not the second. The primitives we really have here are "animal horns (first 3 strokes)" and "big/dog (last 3 strokes)." What are the BIGGEST ANIMAL HORNS that you can think of? For me its a MASTODON. STORY: In caveman times, you SENT OFF packages with the MASTODON express.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 15-7-2009(28): I couldn't stand the <em>horny St. Bernard</em> any longer, so I <strong>escorted</strong> it to the <em>road</em> and gave it a<strong> send off</strong> to go get neutered.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad">bihzad</a>] 22-5-2008(14): (note: I changed golden calf to Satan: came from heaven and grew horns) Satan was escorted by Michael during his<strong> send off</strong> down the roads of heaven.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slats70">slats70</a>] 10-4-2009(12): Primitive: Animal horns + big =<em> Wooly Mammoth</em>. Story:There was a big<strong> send off</strong> for <em>Wooly mammoth</em> and all his friends waved goodbye as he left down the <em>road</em>.</p>
