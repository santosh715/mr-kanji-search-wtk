<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 7-10-2006(33): When you see <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> near a <em>house</em>, it will<strong> imply</strong> that Pinocchio isn't far off.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kusterdu">kusterdu</a>] 28-9-2008(19): The talking cricket says, "you've been spending a lot of time in the house lately," and you say, "What is that supposed to mean?", to which the cricket replies, "I'm<strong> imply</strong>ing you need to get a job!".</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 19-12-2009(8): The <em>talking cricket</em> has lived in Gepetto's <em>house</em> for a century, but in noting this I do not intend to<strong> imply</strong> anything irregular in their relations.
