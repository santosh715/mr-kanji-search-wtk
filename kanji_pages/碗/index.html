<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 23-11-2008(53): <strong>Teacup</strong>s at the Japanese restaurant are usually made of stone and have the name and address of the restaurant written on them.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 21-11-2008(9): Similarly to the <a href="../v4/2487.html">wooden bowl</a> (#2487 椀), the<strong> teacup</strong> made of <em>stone</em> has it's makers <em>address</em> carved into the bottom.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave">synewave</a>] 11-10-2006(8): <strong>Teacup</strong> = 茶碗 （ちゃわん）. Pieces of <em>stone</em>(?) that everyone has at their <em>address</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 25-5-2008(2): Stone, adress: <strong>Teacups</strong> for the tea ceremony are usually made out of <em>stone</em>. Since many students attend the tea ceremony course, everyone had to write their <em>address</em> on the back side, to be able to distinguish between all these similar cups.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 5-12-2009(1): <em>Stoned address</em>: What did you say was in that<strong> teacup</strong>? I drank it on Blind Faith: Oh, and I'm wasted, and I can't find my way home.</p>
