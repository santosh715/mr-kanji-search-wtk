<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 27-11-2008(156): Behold Mister T (of "A-Team" fame)! I chose Mr.T because he's sure to make amusing stories. He is a very versatile character since he's both the big, tough guy and the “moralistic”<strong> person</strong>, telling kids not “to do drugs or alcohol”. He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr">ziggr</a>] 1-10-2006(44): [I appreciate some people's occasional habit of using <em>P</em> for <strong>person</strong> in shared stories. That makes it easier to substitute <em>Mr. T</em>, <em>Captain Picard</em>, or whomever else a student is using as <strong>person.</strong>].</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ImaginaryJapan">ImaginaryJapan</a>] 31-12-2009(31): <em>Khatzumoto</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones">DrJones</a>] 31-12-2007(30): For this character, I'm going to use Chuck Norris. He is a world class martial artist, winning several karate championships in a row. He also achieved ultimate power according to his Chuck Norris Facts, and works as a Texas Ranger (sheriff). He is however a very kind and religious<strong> person</strong>. Here we have a view of his powerful legs, while the contracted form shows him performing a roundhouse kick.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/didz13">didz13</a>] 19-8-2008(24): JESUS.</p>
