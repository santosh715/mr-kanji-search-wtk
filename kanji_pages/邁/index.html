<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 4-11-2007(28): I see lots of 10,000 yen notes just lying on the <em>road</em> and think, "Should I stop and pick them up?" But then I realise they are <em>old 10,000</em>'s (i.e. worthless) and decide I’ll just<strong> pass through</strong>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 24-1-2009(10): I wonder if I can<strong> pass through</strong> this <em>old road</em>, it looks <em>10000</em> years old.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(3): This is a secret <strong>passthrough</strong> in <em>Mario Kart Road</em> - it is a flower-lined, hidden tunnel, and an awesome way to<strong> pass through</strong> directly to the finish line and beat everyone! But there's a guard there - <em>Jiminy Cricket</em> - that won't let anyone through - saying that it's against his <em>conscience</em>. You try to pay him off with a bunch of money, and he won't budge. Then you remember an item you picked up - an old <em>１０万円Jiminy Bill</em>. Being a collector, he accepts and lets you<strong> pass through</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 22-1-2010(2): When Moses was leading the Israelites thru the wilderness he asked a nearby ruler, "May we<strong> PASS THROUGH</strong> your territory? There's only about TEN THOUSAND of us and I promise we'll stay on the old ROAD.".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dubitable">dubitable</a>] 16-10-2010(1): Reminds me of the Biblical proverb, easier than a camel to<strong> PASS THROUGH</strong> the eye of a needle than a rich man (with 10,000 yen, say) to<strong> PASS THROUGH</strong> the gates of heaven (via the ROAD-WAY).</p>
