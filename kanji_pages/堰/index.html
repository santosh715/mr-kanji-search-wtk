<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 4-5-2008(49): Soil, box, sun, woman: In Peru, they were constructing a<strong> dam</strong> and to this end, <em>soil</em> was gathered from the surrounds. During the excavations, they found a <em>box</em>, containing little statue of the <em>sun</em> <em>woman</em> (godess). A nice archeological find, but detrimental for the<strong> dam</strong> building efforts, since the work was to be halted.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey">icamonkey</a>] 11-8-2009(18): To build the<strong> dam</strong>, <em>soil</em> was collected and carried in <em>cardboard boxes</em>. And when the <em>sun</em> got hot, they made the <em>women</em> do it.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde">billyclyde</a>] 1-3-2008(10): All the<strong> dam</strong>s were built by the Army Corps of Engineers' Ladies' Auxiliary. So the WOMEN worked under the SUN all day, with a BOX full of DIRT on their shoulders, to &amp; fro, building up the dirt wall that would become this mighty<strong> dam</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 14-2-2008(6): This is a picnic: a 宴 <a href="../v4/191.html">banquet</a> (#191 宴) outside of the house, sitting on a flattened <em>box</em> on the <em>soil</em>. This particular picnic is happening in the shadow of the<strong> dam</strong>, hope it doesn't burst and wash away all our food.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 22-7-2009(4): Workers constructing the<strong> dam</strong> bring a <em>boxed lunch</em> (a <em>banquet</em> in a <em>box</em> without a house under which to eat it) and try not to get <em>soil</em> in it.</p>
