<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 19-1-2009(26): When she's playing the<strong> lute</strong> between your two balls Japanese censors mosaic it out.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 8-6-2008(12): Two kings, mosaic: The contest of the <em>two kings</em> continued, but now they were to play the<strong> lute</strong>. However, their<strong> lute</strong> playing was so bad, the precious <em>mosaics</em> fell down the walls.. and were looted by the crowd.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma">kumakuma</a>] 19-1-2009(3): The<strong> lute</strong> is a good name for the thing between your TWO JEWELS, which is often behind a pixel MOSAIC on film.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(3): The ancient tradition of producing <strong>lute</strong>s has been lost, but fortunately there's now a new<strong> lute</strong> synthesizer out. It's a <em>Rubik's Cube</em> made out of two colors of <em>gems</em>. You rotate the blocks to make different sounds. This may sound difficult, but hey, if you think about how hard it was to play the actual ancient<strong> lute</strong> itself, it's actually not bad at all.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama">kapalama</a>] 16-10-2010(2): 琵琶湖 , 琵琶市 , <a href="../v4/2913.html">lute</a> (#2913 琶) わ … Parts: ( <a href="http://google.com/#q=琵−比">琵−比</a> ) , 巴 .. (cf 琴 <a href="../v4/1591.html">harp</a> (#1591 琴), 琵 <a href="../v4/2912.html">biwa</a> (#2912 琵)) … Note :This is <em>only</em> used for the 2nd kanji for Biwa, and place names like Lake Biwa. Double King is a <em>Harp Primitive</em> of sorts, it seems … Story:You want me to remember a kanji for <strong>Lute</strong>? <em>Wha'???</em> (reading). <strong>2nd character for <em>Biwa</em></strong>, not <strong>lute</strong>, aka it is the <em>Fertilizer ( 巴 )</em> end of <em>Biwa</em>.</p>
