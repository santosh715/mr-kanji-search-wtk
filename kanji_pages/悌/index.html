<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 16-10-2008(30): The <em>state of mind</em> of a <em>younger brother</em> has<strong> respect for elders</strong>, including you if you're the elder brother.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon">abaddon</a>] 10-5-2008(17): Data, younger brother: Commander <em>Data</em> had a <em>younger, amoral brother</em> (Lore). When they visited an old computer museum, Lore remarked that he could compute much faster than the machines on exhibition. That's when Data found it to be his duty to teach his brother <strong>respect for elders</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 11-11-2008(11): The one family member who doesn't have<strong> respect for elders</strong> is the <em>younger brother</em>. In his immature <em>state of mind</em> he makes farting noises while playing with his food.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki">CasualTatsumaki</a>] 1-7-2010(1): Data's younger brother makes farting noises and has no<strong> respect for elders</strong> (thanks cameron_en).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 19-1-2009(1): Just picture the TIN MAN slapping the YOUNGER BROTHER (some stupid little munchkin) with an axe for not showing RESPECT FOR THE ELDERS (in this case, the Wizard of Oz).</p>
