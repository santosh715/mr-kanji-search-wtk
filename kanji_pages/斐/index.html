<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 21-12-2008(25): The murderer who carved <strong>symmetrical patterns</strong> into all his victims was <em>sentenced</em> life in a <em>jailcell</em>. (thanks tomusan).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(13): In <em>jail</em>, everyone wears symetrically patterned clothes - usually stripes. In this, particularly fashionable <em>Scottish</em> jail, however, they have you wear <em>plaid</em>. It makes sense if you think about it - most jails have vertical bars, which translates into stripes - while this <em>Scottish</em> joint has squarish, symetrically patterned bars that go very well with <em>plaid</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(5): <em>Chun-Li</em> gave the <em>death row inmate</em> a<strong> symmetrically patterned</strong> footprint on the top of his head with a foot stomp cross-up.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq">Doodsaq</a>] 2-11-2010(3): A cop stops me while driving on LSD. I shakily role down the window and the officer immediately barks, "Think of a<strong> symmetrically patterned</strong> sentence right now or I'll throw your ass in a jailcell!" I mumble: "Mr. Owl ate my metal worm".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/manubear">manubear</a>] 10-8-2012(2): Groundskeeper Willie is in <em>jail</em>. Of course he's still wearing his <strong>symmetrically patterned</strong> <em>kilt</em> ( やり甲斐がある ).</p>
