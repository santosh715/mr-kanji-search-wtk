<h2>Reading:</h2>

<h3>On-Yomi: <a>リョウ</a> </h3>


	
    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>pup tent The St. Bernard dog and its overlapping with the element for teepee are enough to suggest the meaning of this primitive element: a pup tent. The combination of sun and little at the bottom can mean a little opening or flap through which the sun shines in the morning to let you know it’s time for getting up. [12]</p>
	

  	
    
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad">LazyNomad</a>] 18-6-2009(134): Trivia: The right primitive is <em>kagaribi</em> - 尞 - <em>fuel used for sacrifices</em>. I would use <em>sacred bonfire</em> as a primitive . (Mnemonic: Top is a merged image of <em>big</em> and <em>fire</em> - <em>big sacred bonfire</em> that looks like <em>little sun</em>). Story: Your<strong> colleague</strong> got fired literally… in a <em>sacred bonfire</em> by Mr.T.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn">aircawn</a>] 16-2-2007(100): Some businesses allow pets in the office. Here, my<strong> colleague</strong> is <em>Mr T</em> and he set up a little <em>pup tent</em> for his minidog, then turns around and completes his TPS reports.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal">the_marshal</a>] 26-6-2006(80): Mr. T began working in a japanese compagny. As he sees that his<strong> colleague</strong> accept to do some extra work during the week-end and even sleep at the office, he says to them: "I pity da fool who work during week-end! You might as well install a pup tent in the office and forget about your home".</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/takoman">takoman</a>] 11-6-2008(20): (リョウ) When Ned (<em>insert male person here</em>) gets a <em>pup tent</em> (i.e. a woody), he calls it his "colleague." (again, sorry for the crudeness of many of my stories).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn">Johnnyltn</a>] 30-9-2006(15): A<strong> colleague</strong> implies someone that you share work with, such as in your company or profession, etc. Here your<strong> colleague</strong> helps you to erect your <em>pup tent</em> during a company outing. Note: <strong>Heisig's warning</strong> to keep this distinct from other similiar kanji such as <a href="../v4/19.html">companion</a> (#19 朋), <a href="../v4/704.html">friend</a> (#704 友), <a href="../v4/1203.html">consort</a> (#1203 伴) and <a href="../v4/1637.html">comrade</a> (#1637 輩). That is why I chose to have the <em>person</em> element pictured as someone (the<strong> colleague</strong> in this case) helping with the work of building the <em>pup tent</em>.</p>
