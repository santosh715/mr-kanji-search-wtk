<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n">decamer0n</a>] 25-4-2007(216): Actually, the lower-right primitive isn't quite "walking legs." It's a little more like "evening" with an extra stroke across it (look up the stroke order). So, it helps me to see this kanji for<strong> night</strong> as: <em>evening</em> plus an extra stroke representing the tuxedo tails to match the <em>top hat</em> which my special <em>person</em> is wearing out on the town…</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 18-10-2005(86): Here we have <em>Mister T</em> sleepwalking, wearing a <em>top hat</em> as if he was the ambassador of the<strong> night</strong>, walking, and walking and walking on his tired <em>walking legs</em>, until he <em>drops</em> (back into his bed).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 9-1-2008(46): An elegant vampire. Going out in his<strong> night</strong> suit with a top hat, the creature looks like a person with long walking legs. The drop is the blood that the vampire seeks.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 8-1-2008(14): See this as an example of when the oldest profession in the world – prostitution – prefers to work. Even the wealthiest of gentleman in their <em>top hats</em> are ordinary <em>people</em>, and will not decline to deposit their <em>drops</em> between the <em>walking legs</em> of the streetwalkers out in the<strong> night</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harkren">harkren</a>] 15-8-2009(10): Mr T was taking a stroll during the evening with his brand new top hat, and without even noticing, it turned from evening to<strong> night</strong> in a dash.</p>
