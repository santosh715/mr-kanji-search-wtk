    <h2>Primitive:</h2>
    <p>paper punch This primitive simply discards the first stroke of that for hole to become a paper punch. When found at the top of its relative primitive, it undergoes the same change, the eight becoming human legs (see FRAME 1316 穴). [4]</p>
	

  	
    
  
  
  


<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon">gorgon</a>] 20-2-2006(183): A pictograph of a japanese schoolgirl getting<strong> grope</strong>d by perverts on the train. The <em>fingers</em> of course, a <em>crown</em> (her too short skirt) and her <em>legs</em> below (which to be honest are pretty thick like <em>tree</em> trunks).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 6-1-2012(121): Note: "<em>crown+human legs</em>" appears 7 times in RTK. In 4 cases (nos. 323, 1327, 1328, 2920) <em>crown</em> is above <em>human legs</em>, and in the other 3 (1888, 2472, 2679) one leg passes through the crown. I call the 1st pattern "<em>Miss World</em>" (who is wearing a <em>crown</em> &amp; has long <em>human legs</em>) and the 2nd "<em>garter</em>" (one <em>human leg</em> passes through the <em>crown</em> wearing it as a <em>garter</em>). Story: <em>Miss World</em> has climbed a <em>tree</em> to avoid the <em>finger</em> that was <strong>groping</strong> for her. ( 探 means "grope for", i.e. search).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax">Zarxrax</a>] 31-5-2008(69): (based on gorgon's story) a pictograph of a japanese schoolgirl getting<strong> grope</strong>d by perverts on the train. The <em>fingers</em> of course, a <em>crown</em> (her too short skirt) and her <em>legs</em> below. It's her own fault for wearing such a short skirt and causing the perverts to get <em>wood</em>!</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-12-2006(57): I don't know why, but this is a pictograph of someone groping about in the dark (with his fingers, obviously) for his beloved wooden paper punch.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 17-1-2008(39): As esaulgd said, this kanji DOES NOT mean "touch" like <a href="midori://search?text=触る。">触る。</a> Here is my story: Imagine a blind detective who must<strong> GROPE</strong> for answers in by reading old police reports. But because he is blind, he must use brail books, you know, the ones that have been PAPER PUNCHED on PAPER (wood). Naturally, he uses his FINGERS for this.</p>
