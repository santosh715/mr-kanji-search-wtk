<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo">Katsuo</a>] 10-12-2012(53): Note that the meaning of this (rare) kanji is "<strong>make</strong> (something) / <strong>do</strong> (something)", not "get by with". Story: <em>Mr. T</em> doesn't rely on <em>happenstance</em>, he <strong>makes</strong> things <strong>do</strong> what he wants. Edit: In fact three Japanese kanji dictionaries I checked all list 做 as an alternative to 作 <a href="../v4/1142.html">make</a> (#1142 作), so "<strong>make (alt)</strong>" might be the best keyword. Story: <em>Mr. T</em> by <em>happenstance</em> found an <strong>alt</strong>ernative way to <strong>make</strong> things. (See also bennyb &amp; faneca's notes).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bennyb">bennyb</a>] 4-4-2010(7): (food for thought) I know this is RTK3 and all, but this kanji seems almost completely useless. The two most common phrases it's included in are 言い做す to speak as though something were actually the case and 見なす to regard (as equivalent). Both of which USUALLY just write なすin kana, and neither of which have anything to do with the meaning. In fact I can't find any trace of Katsuo's suggestion of this meaning. Anyone care to enlighten me? Perhaps this one's worth skipping.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys">ikmys</a>] 17-4-2007(6): <em>Mr. T</em> is an <em>old</em>-school <em>taskmaster</em>. He <strong>makes</strong> all his little T's <strong>do</strong> their chores and <strong>do</strong> their homework before bed. "I ain't gonna let those kids slide!".</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 7-1-2007(6): A <em>person</em> should try to make his own luck, but sometimes you have to<strong> make do</strong> with <em>happenstance</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/faneca">faneca</a>] 14-7-2012(4): @bennyb: As much as I usually love katsuo's contributions, I agree with you this time. For the sense you mention, I guess "<strong>figuratively</strong>" would be a better keyword. See [1]: <a href="http://google.com/#q=「見做す」">「見做す」</a> "to regard [figuratively] as", <a href="http://google.com/#q=「思い做しか」">「思い做しか」</a> "imagination (to think [figuratively])", etc. On the other hand, look at the Chinese compounds at [2]: it clearly means "make"/"do" ( 做爱 to make love, 做梦 to dream).
