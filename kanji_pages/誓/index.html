<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 21-10-2005(240): This Japanese couple wrote the<strong> vow</strong>s that they had made to each other onto a piece of paper and then <em>folded it into an origami</em>, and put it somewhere in their appartment. To everybody else it is an <em>origami</em>, but to them it is also a symbol of their<strong> vow</strong>s. – "the <em>folded words</em> are<strong> vow</strong>s". Note : in this story and a few others I use the image of an <em>origami</em> for the primitive "<em>fold</em>".</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 19-12-2007(81): A Japanese wedding tradition is to present each other with <em>origami cranes</em> with their <strong>vows</strong> <em>written</em> on the BOTTOM.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 11-2-2009(50): Sadako Sasaki<strong> vow</strong>ed to <em>fold</em> 1000 paper cranes and kept her <em>word</em>. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadako_Sasaki">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadako_Sasaki</a>).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon">dukelexon</a>] 18-2-2008(15): If you're a sci-fi/fantasy reader –&gt; The Aes Sedai of Robert Jordan's "The Wheel of Time" series were famously forced to take three<strong> vow</strong>s, one of which was to never lie. This was next to pointless, however, as the old broads easily got around it by being so skilled at <em>folding</em> their <em>words</em> that while they never TECHNICALLY lied … the absolute truth that they spoke was still highly deceptive.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 21-6-2007(13): After cutting himself badly, <em>Socrates</em><strong> vow</strong>ed never to <em>fold</em> origami again.</p>
