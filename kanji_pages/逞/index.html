<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 22-1-2010(8): An especially<strong> TOUGH</strong> form of discipline was used in old Japan. Criminals would be tied up or crucified on posts and put on DISPLAY and their blood would DROP onto the ROAD.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo">Neobeo</a>] 30-1-2009(3): The <em>display</em> there says that this <em>really old road</em> is still<strong> tough</strong> and can still be used.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(3): This is the <strong>tough</strong>est part of <em>Mario Kart Road</em>. If you finish the game on the hardest mode, you get to fight a boss named, simply,<strong> Tough</strong> Guy. This guy drives around in a kart made completely of hard <em>gems</em>, and has a <em>Shoop Da Woop Mouth</em> mounted on the top of his kart. It's almost impossible to get anywhere near him, but if you can beat him, you get to select him in the normal game!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gaignun">Gaignun</a>] 17-11-2011(2): The <em>road</em> is where young, irresponsible males like to <em>display</em> how "<strong>tough</strong>" they are. It is because of them that my car insurance premiums are so high!</p>
