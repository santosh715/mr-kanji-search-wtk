<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 11-9-2007(182): The <em>Scotsman goalkeeper</em> <strong>adjusted</strong> himself. He reached down and <strong>adjusted</strong> the <em>two things</em> between his skinny fencepost <em>legs</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 23-2-2008(49): This kanji means "symmetry" not "adjusted." STORY: The TWO FENCEPOSTS need to be SYMMETRICAL in size, otherwise you may smash your mouth into the lower side and start saying naughty SENTENCES.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact">RoboTact</a>] 2-8-2007(31): You are trying to stretch a <em>plaid</em> between <em>two</em> <em>fenceposts</em>. It's not easy, as for all wrinkles to go away posts' positions must be carefully <strong>adjusted</strong>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FudoMyo">FudoMyo</a>] 26-4-2007(28): HINT: this kanji as a primitive can mean <em>goalkeeper</em>. The "fence posts" are goalposts, and the two goalkeepers wear plaid uniforms (this kanji also means <strong>uniform</strong> as in even), making them uniform with each other and distinguishing them as goalkeepers from the rest of the team.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 19-12-2007(20): [+dingomick] The <em>Scottish goalkeeper</em> has lost both of his legs and was forced to replace them with two bent <em>white picket fenceposts</em> nailed together with two boards, but that hasn't stopped him from playing his favorite sport: soccer. Imagine the camera zooming in on him after he makes a great play: "Great save! Ah, there he is reaching under his <em>kilt</em> - he just<strong> adjusted</strong> his fencepost legs. There he goes again, oop, looks like he just<strong> adjusted</strong> something else as well!".</p>
