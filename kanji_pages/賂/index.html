<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty">Megaqwerty</a>] 16-7-2007(68): It might sound simple to bribe someone, but then you have to<strong> graft</strong> the guy above him and the guy below him, and soon you're just giving <em>shells</em> to <em>each</em> and everyone!</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 28-11-2008(18): When I was caught by the police doing some<strong> graft</strong> (graffiti), I gave <em>each</em> cop some <em>clams</em> and told them to be on their way. 賄賂 【わいろ】 bribe.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hunchbag">hunchbag</a>] 7-9-2011(10): <em>Graft: the acquisition of money, gain, or advantage by dishonest, unfair, or illegal means, especially through the abuse of one's position or influence in politics, business, etc. .</em> <em>STORY:</em> The evil corporate extortionist<strong> graft</strong>s all who get within his power. He<strong> GRAFT</strong>s a different amount of MONEY from EACH of his victims. If they have more, he extorts more. He even plots it out on an evil graph!</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/doviende">doviende</a>] 23-10-2011(6): <strong>Graft</strong> is like bribing. You have to give <em>MONEY</em> to <em>EACH</em> person. There's a guy with a briefcase full of money and a walky-talky, and he's going around asking on the walky-talky about who he should give money too. "This guy gets money? Roger.".</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 30-10-2009(5): I take this to mean the verb<strong> graft</strong>, and so simply see a bunch of shellfish being <strong>grafted</strong> onto <em>each</em> other, <em>each</em> to <em>each</em>.</p>
