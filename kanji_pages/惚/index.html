<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 18-2-2007(58): <strong>Infatuation</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> that makes a <em>knot</em> form in your <em>heart</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser">theasianpleaser</a>] 8-1-2009(10): <em>Data </em><a href="../v4/2431.html">instantaneously</a> (#2431 忽)忽 combusted when he first experienced<strong> infatuation</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 22-3-2007(7): <strong>Infatuation</strong> is a <em>state of mind</em> where you should know that what you feel probably is <em>not</em> something that touches your <em>heart</em> for real.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen">terozen</a>] 9-2-2012(3): <strong>Infatuation</strong> is the <em>state of mind</em> when you <em><a href="../v4/2431.html">instantaneously</a> (#2431 忽)</em> fall in love.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 28-7-2008(3): (cross generation, but who cares) <em>Data</em> finally gets the <em>heart</em> transplant he has been wishing for - now he can feel emotion! The first emotion he feels, though, is<strong> infatuation</strong> for Seven of Nine…he can't get her out of his <em>heart</em>. It starts to interfere with his work, and he decides that enough is enough. He can't very well throw away the <em>heart</em> (it would offend the captain), but he has to do something…so he pulls his new <em>heart</em> out of his body, and ties it in a <em>knot</em>. No more<strong> infatuation</strong>.</p>
