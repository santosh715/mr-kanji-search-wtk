<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 24-4-2007(57): I never play the <strong>lottery</strong>. I'd rather be whacked by <em>bamboo</em> staffs as I pass down an <em>assembly line</em> than do that. Of course, when a buddy wins, I'll go to the <em>fiesta</em> and enjoy the special salsa packed with <em>green onions</em>, but I will never play the <strong>lottery</strong> myself.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 4-11-2008(21): (based on mantixen's) If I won the<strong> lottery</strong>, I wouldn't even need to go speed dating (a <em>fiesta</em> to form <em>couples</em>) to find a woman, even if I had <em>onion</em>breath they'd be flocking in my direction. On second thoughts.. I'd better buy a bamboo cane to keep the ugly ones away.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman">herman</a>] 29-12-2008(11): Better remembered as raffle. Picture a dating event (fiesta to form couples) where a raffle/lottery is held for a date with the most attractive person of each gender. Everybody pulls from a pot, if you get bamboo you lose, green onions you win!</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly">KristinHolly</a>] 9-1-2009(5): Two people are having a fiesta to celebrate having won the<strong> lottery</strong>. Hurray! However, this was a small<strong> lottery</strong> win, so they're just making a stir fry with bamboo shoots and chopped green onions. Someday maybe they'll win big.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 12-10-2008(5): If I won the<strong> lottery</strong>, I'd hold speed dating (a <em>fiesta</em> to form <em>couples</em>) events catered by <em>chef Chun-Li</em> in a <em>bamboo</em> grove with me as the only male participant.</p>
