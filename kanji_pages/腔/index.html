<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 16-10-2006(49): A<strong> body cavity</strong> is an <em>empty</em> space within your <em>flesh</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon">to_nihon</a>] 11-1-2009(10): During a <strong>body cavity</strong> search, the police check certain <em>parts of your body</em> to make sure they're <em>empty</em> of things like cocaine, etc..</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 27-1-2011(): A<strong> body cavity</strong> is a <em>part of the body</em> that would be <em>empty</em> if all the fluid was drained from the body.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 19-7-2010(): Just as you can get a tooth cavity, the little people also comes at night and creates a <strong>body cavity</strong>. They dig out your <em>flesh</em> and leaves an <em>empty</em> space behind, and will start construction of the 'little people town' if you aren't careful with hygiene. If you would dare to peek in on them, they will all run away and hide. On the right you can see the legs of one of them as it's trying to run through the roof to hide, leaving it's construction I-beam behind. It's the little people, I tell you!</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/n1williams">n1williams</a>] 9-12-2009(): Butchers make sure the<strong> BODY CAVITY</strong> is clean. They look at the FLESH and make sure it is EMPTY.</p>
