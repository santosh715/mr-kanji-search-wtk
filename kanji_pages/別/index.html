<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/leviathan">leviathan</a>] 20-3-2006(154): I don't know about you but to me this seems like someone's head is about to be<strong> separate</strong>d from his body. You can see he's kneeling and his mouth is wide open gasping for the last breath he will ever take.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thatkidpercy">thatkidpercy</a>] 16-11-2007(119): A wise old samurai keeps his hostages (with their <em>mouths bound up</em> to keep them quiet) in a<strong> separate</strong> room from his <em>sabers</em>. Putting them together would be a silly mistake.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham">Christine_Tham</a>] 3-8-2007(69): The prisoner with the BOUND MOUTH was<strong> separate</strong>d from his SABRE.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey">tharvey</a>] 12-11-2009(16): They<strong> separate</strong>d me from the group. They gagged my <em>mouth</em>, <em>bound</em> me up, and threatened me with a <em>saber</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/canji">canji</a>] 3-1-2010(13): In Empire Strikes Back, Luke was hanging upside down, muttered with his <em>mouth</em> "Ben, Ben, Ben", his feet <em>bound</em> in ice, he was <strong>separated</strong> from his light <em>sabre</em>. And he could hear the monster coming for him.</p>
