<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild">Stormchild</a>] 5-9-2006(200): The tortoise has escaped! We tied it up with a<strong> straw rope</strong>, but all that's left of the rope are some torn <em>threads</em>, and the <em>unbound tortoise</em> is nowhere to be found. (Note that the right half here is not "eels". This is (in my opinion) a mistake in the RTK book, as we already decided in <a href="../v4/537.html">waterfall</a> (#537 滝) to refer to the simplified form of dragon as "eels". It is much better to call the right half of this character an "unbound tortoise".).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular">Zactacular</a>] 28-9-2007(145): When <em>Spiderman</em> fights the giant <em>tortoise</em>, he grabs a<strong> straw rope</strong> from the edges of the sumo ring and swings it at his head. However, the <em>tortoise</em> quickly tucks his head back into his shell to avoid the blow (hence no head on the <em>tortoise</em>).</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 2-4-2007(30): A<strong> straw rope</strong> is made from <em>threads</em> and has about the thickness of an <em>eel</em>.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 22-9-2008(21): Our friendly neighborhood <em>Spider-Man</em> takes off the<strong> straw rope</strong> that was <em>binding</em> the <em>tortoise</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 14-4-2008(13): <em>Spiderman's</em> threads conduct electricity a bit too well, so when he has to bind up <em>electric eels</em>, he just buys some<strong> straw rope</strong> at the post office and shoots it out of his arm. Ouch, that stuff sure leaves a rash.</p>
