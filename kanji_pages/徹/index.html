<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall">pmbeddall</a>] 9-1-2008(190): The <em>taskmistress</em> in a moment of weakness allowed the man's <em>column</em> to<strong> penetrate</strong> her. As punishment he was made to <em>bring up</em> their infant.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 7-11-2005(122): Ha! In this frame, a bunch of taskmasters are lined up to<strong> penetrate</strong> the kids they raise/bring up! I'm thinking of some priests and choir boys.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk">rtkrtk</a>] 10-1-2008(65): Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to<strong> penetrate</strong> enemy <em>line</em>s (or the <em>columns</em> of soliders). It won't be easy: the soldiers have been <em>brought up</em> since birth, by the <em>taskmaster</em>, to be on guard. To remember <em>brought up</em>, imagine horrible Orcs being created and <em>brought up</em> through black magic and pledging their allegiance to the evil <em>taskmaster</em>. These aren't Orc recruits; these are Orcs that have been created through black magic and <em>brought up</em> to destroy the enemy.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh">tomtosh</a>] 3-9-2007(55): <strong>Penetrate</strong> = "<strong>goes</strong> into." As in the lessons of the taskmaster penetrating the minds of those he his bringing up.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru">Danieru</a>] 24-6-2008(26): Compare the two kanji for 'penetrate' and 'remove': here, the child who wasn't <em>raised / brought up</em> with very good manners is <em>going</em> to give his taskmaster a big <em>kancho</em>. After he is<strong> penetrate</strong>d, his angry parents tell him to <a href="../v4/760.html">remove</a> (#760 撤) his finger. (Don't know what a kancho is? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kancho">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kancho</a>).</p>
