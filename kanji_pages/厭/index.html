<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 19-8-2006(73): The poor <em>chihuahua</em> who had fallen down a <em>cliff</em> was totally<strong> despondent</strong> about his position. He saw the <em>sun</em> and the <em>moon</em> pass by, but expected no rescue any more.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 28-6-2008(7): While you may know the story of Hachikou, this is about a <em>chihuahua</em> that lost its master. They used to play a game - <em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em> - where the master would stand at the top of a cliff and wave his hands as if to resemble sunrays, and the dog would lie on the ground in a crescent shape - then they would switch. But one day the master fell! The dog, for years after, would go to the spot where he fell at <em>sun</em> and <em>moon</em> rise and look<strong> despondent</strong>. Imagine the<strong> despondent</strong> puppydog eyes.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun">koohiikun</a>] 21-6-2010(3): Under a <em>cliff</em>, the <em>sun</em> beating on its <em>flesh</em>, our <em>chihuahua</em> is<strong> despondent</strong> realizing there's no Taco Bell around here.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 13-10-2008(2): A<strong> despondent</strong> <em>chihuahua</em> sits at the base of the <em>cliff</em> and watches the <em>sun</em> and <em>moon</em> cycle around.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets">Boy.pockets</a>] 15-1-2011(1): The <em>chihuahua</em> had become<strong> despondent</strong> as the <em>sun</em> was going down and the <em>moon </em>was coming p and he was still stuck at the base of the <em>cliff</em>.</p>
