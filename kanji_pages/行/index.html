<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackhuddleston">jackhuddleston</a>] 3-5-2008(76): To me, this looks like a bridge<strong> going</strong> over a body of water, being supported by columns underneath it. Being that I live near the ocean, I see tourists and vacationers coming and<strong> going</strong> constantly on the bridge. Because the bridge is so long, it forms an arc to support the structural integrity. You can see that arc here.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus">scottamus</a>] 4-11-2005(53): I use <em>The Flash</em> for for this primitive; a superhero who is always <em>going</em> very fast.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu">fuaburisu</a>] 10-10-2005(32): See book. * As a primitive I will prefer to use the meaning of column whenever possible, and use the image of columns of the temples of ancient Greece (such as Corinthian columns). The primitive meaning of line is best avoided in my opinion because it is very close to FRAME 812 “file”.<strong> Going</strong> is not very graphic, but may be used when a mnemonic calls for it.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq">nilfisq</a>] 8-9-2007(30): For those who need a mnemonic in order not to forget how to write this kanji, think of katakana イテ <em>ite</em> (here the イeven gets a dot): <em>ite</em> in Latin means <em>go</em>! +++ As for the primitive: I'll use <em>i</em> as in <em>iTunes</em> or <em><strong>i</strong>tinerary</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hyreia">Hyreia</a>] 4-3-2009(12): I was having a hard time using 'columns' and 'going' for the left-side later on. What helped me was using it as "crossing the line". You know, as in "going too far". This might help, it did for me.</p>
