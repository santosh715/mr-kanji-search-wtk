<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 31-1-2011(7): Looking around on the internet, the only word I can find with this kanji is 斡旋 (あっせん) which means <strong>mediation</strong>. STORY: Mediation is what you do when two parties have a <em>mist</em> between them. You put up an <em>umbrella</em> between them, get them to come together, and measure out something for each of them to keep in a <em>measuring cup</em>.</p>

Under<strong> auspices</strong> of the mayor of Tokyo, contestants were to ride a bike through the <em>mist</em> and collect it in their <em>umbrella</em>. Then it was put in a <em>measuring cup</em> so that the winner would be known.</p>
