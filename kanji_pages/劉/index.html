<h2 id="koohii-stories">Koohii stories:</h2>

<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops">astridtops</a>] 6-4-2007(33): Because the police had confiscated the <em>swords</em> (though they got a <em>receipt</em> in return) from the group of men protecting the <em>gold</em> transport, bandits attacked them with <em>sabers</em> and<strong> slaughter</strong>ed every last one of them.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant">sgrant</a>] 5-5-2009(21): The <em>ransom note</em> explained that if the <em>gold</em> was not received by the following morning, the victim would be <strong>slaughtered</strong> with a <em>saber</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 13-10-2008(10): A guy brought a <em>receipt</em> and a <em>sword</em> to Wal-Mart customer service asking for a refund in <em>gold</em>, but when they didn't give it to him, he pulled out another <em>saber</em> and<strong> slaughter</strong>ed all the employees.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bennyb">bennyb</a>] 11-4-2010(6): Xtra info: In case anyone's wondering about the actual relevance of this character: Nelson's Dict. lists it as meaning "axe" or "kill," and only gives りゅう as a reading. RTK3 book lists the compound 劉封 りゅうほう, the "name of an early Han-dynasty emperor." I bet your best chance of seeing this in "the wild" (outside rtk3) would be in a name, esp. a samurai-drama ( 時代劇 ).</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en">cameron_en</a>] 13-11-2008(4): Officer: "Do you have a receipt for that <em>dagger</em>?" Boy: "Well, no.. It's just a piece of scrap metal" Officer: "In that case I'm gonna have to<strong> slaughter</strong> you with my <em>sabre</em>!".</p>
