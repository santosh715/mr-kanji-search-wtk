<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 2-8-2009(27): The <em>body part</em> that gets wet when you wade through the <em>sewers</em> (a <em>crafted</em> <em>flood</em> underneath the <em>ground</em>) is your<strong> shin</strong> (thanks brian44).</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44">brian44</a>] 13-2-2008(10): The right side actually has to do with a sort of undersround water tunnel, check any chinese hanzi dictionary and you will see <a href="http://www.zhongwen.com/">http://www.zhongwen.com/</a> .</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 16-8-2008(8): [+brian44] is right - so I'll try using the right primitive as <em>sewers</em>. I've been using Ninja Turtles and stuff though, so I'll have to use this as a series of narrow, long, lead pipes that bring <em>floods</em> of water to the city. Here, someone has taken a lead <em>sewer pipe</em> and hit you in the part of your <em>flesh</em> that is most vulnerable to impact: your<strong> shin</strong> (after years of soccer/football, I can't think of the word<strong> shin</strong> without thinking of pain).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate">mcfate</a>] 13-11-2007(3): I remember the right-hand half as "barge" – it's flat like a <em>floor</em>, it's easy to <em>craft</em>, and it will float above a <em>flood</em> (it appears again later). It's dangerous to stand on a barge (too easy to fall off), or sit (might slide off) – it's best to rest on the <em>part of the body</em> that is your<strong> shin</strong>s.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 29-1-2010(2): Easy if you have a friend named<strong> Shin</strong>, or can imagine one: he has his<strong> shin</strong>, the <em>body part</em> homophonous with his name, stuck in a <em>sewer</em>. Poor<strong> Shin</strong>.</p>
