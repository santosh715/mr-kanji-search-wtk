<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 17-6-2007(195): <em>Mr. T</em> is<strong> praise</strong>d for his <em>protecting</em> of the trees by being given a <em>top hat and scarf</em> which he wears over his mohawk and chains, respectively.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TunS77">TunS77</a>] 28-7-2009(33): I have to<strong> praise</strong> this <em>tophat and scarf</em>, it sure did do a great job <em>protecting</em> me from the cold!</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/darg_sama">darg_sama</a>] 7-11-2005(23): The guard that protects the castle is<strong> praise</strong>d for his top hat and scarf. Unfortunately, he's one of those royal guards in front of the palace in England, so he's not allowed to say anything. The top hat and scarf were placed on him by a tourist as a joke, and the "praise" is really his cohorts mocking him.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583">daredawg3583</a>] 19-3-2008(21): <strong>Praise</strong> be to Jesus, who was once thought of as PATHETIC, but actually PROTECTED us (from death/sin, etc), and is worthy of<strong> praise</strong>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo">Ricardo</a>] 14-1-2007(15): [praise; extol] A kid will only hear <strong>praise</strong> from his/her mother if he/she is wearing a <em>top hat</em> and <em>scarf</em> to be<em>protect</em>ed from the cold outside, just like she's always asking…</p>
