<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sweetneet">sweetneet</a>] 20-3-2006(78): A kid gets<strong> scold</strong>ed if they don't put the <em>spoon</em> properly into their <em>mouth</em> when eating.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora">Yozora</a>] 6-9-2009(36): Kids get<strong> scold</strong>ed if they don't open their MOUTH to take their SPOONFUL of medicine.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paasan">paasan</a>] 5-7-2010(12): Here's a story I read many years ago in a magazine. It was about a girl who was lonely and wanting and decided to play with a banana. While doing this, she suddenly heard her parents returning home, and being startled, the banana broke inside her. Her mom then had to use a spoon to get the banana out of this poor girl while she was being <strong>scolded</strong>. So actually, this is a pictograph..</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine">Nukemarine</a>] 21-6-2008(12): Well, how do you picture getting<strong> SCOLD</strong>ED? You listen to that MOUTH while you have to SIT DOWN there and take it.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals">decals</a>] 11-11-2010(5): This is NOT spoon. The first stroke of the RHS goes beyond the second stroke. It's diced. STORY: When I try to make dinner, my wife<strong> scold</strong>s me because of my poor dicing technique. "This is too big! It will never fit in our mouths! Dice it again!".</p>
