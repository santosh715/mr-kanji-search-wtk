<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 17-1-2007(255): The <strong>constitution</strong> is important. At least my parents thought so. In the <em>house</em> where I <em>grew up</em>, it was framed on the wall. Under the watchful (sideways) <em>eye</em> of my mother, we had to study it until we knew it by <em>heart</em>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick">dingomick</a>] 4-3-2007(77): The <em>house</em> of US Congress needs to <em>grow up</em>! Their <em>twisted</em> eyes have lost the <em>heart</em> of the <strong>constitution</strong>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha">akrodha</a>] 17-5-2007(49): The original Japanese<strong> constitution</strong> is locked up deep within the Imperial Palace, <em>home</em> of the Emperor. Since its creation, it's gotten <em>bigger and bigger</em>, and it's even grown a <em>pair of eyes</em>, as well as a <em>beating heart</em>. Naturally the Emperor tries to keep this hidden from the public, but what will they do once the<strong> constitution</strong>-monster becomes big enough to destroy the palace?</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Odieone">Odieone</a>] 5-1-2009(34): I <em>grow up</em> in a <em>house</em> which values the<strong> constitution</strong>. My father always told me to look not just with my <em>eyes</em> but with my <em>heart</em> as well.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bennyb">bennyb</a>] 15-6-2009(23): [ +CharleyGarret + Growing up=Peter Pan] In Peter Pan's Lost Boys house, they eye the consitution every day and have learned it by heart. "No Lost Girls, Captain Hook stinks, we'll never grow up! We'll scream till we're pink!" (Hey, I'm trying here - there are no other Peter Pan stories.).</p>
