<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno">chibimizuno</a>] 14-8-2009(26): The<strong> peregrine falcon</strong> is the fastest animal in the world. It can reach speeds of over 322 km/h in a dive - over <em>ten</em> times as fast as a <em>turkey</em>!</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa">dihutenosa</a>] 15-8-2008(20): My<strong> peregrine falcon</strong> recently has been having confidence issues - recently it dives out of the sky and misses the target completely. To boost its confidence, I got a nice, fat <em>turkey</em>, killed it, and then set it up on a big <em>needle</em> so it looked like it was still alive - just loafing about. Then I went to my<strong> peregrine falcon</strong> - "hey buddy, look! A nice fat <em>turkey</em>. I bet you can get it!" It goes for it, but it spears itself on the <em>needle</em>!!</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk">blannk</a>] 23-1-2010(2): Finally it emerges who has been killing the <em>turkey</em>s of RtK3. Dihutenosa! Last <em>turkey</em> down, speared along with dihutenosa's ill-fated<strong> peregrine falcon</strong> on a <em>needle</em>. The latter was 準 <a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/564">semi-</a> (#564 準) conscious for a time, until the last drop of the water of life drained from him. The former leaves behind no living relatives.</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen">mantixen</a>] 31-7-2009(2): The<strong> peregrine falcon</strong> is used to feeding on medium-sized birds, so it would take <em>ten</em> of them to lift up a <em>turkey</em>.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi">Peppi</a>] 24-5-2009(2): A<strong> peregrine falcon</strong> is nothing more than a <em>turkey</em> with a compass <em>needle</em> to find its way.</p>
