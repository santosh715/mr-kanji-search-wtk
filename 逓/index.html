<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf">Virtua_Leaf</a>] 23-1-2008(211): (I prefer <em>2 towels</em> over cornstalk and belt) - Have you ever wondered why your parcels always end up in such bad condition when you get them? Or why you never get them at all? That's because you've never looked at how they're actually delivered - each postman is given a load of<strong> parcel post</strong> and <em>2 towels</em> to <em>drag</em> them down the <em>road</em> on.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett">CharleyGarrett</a>] 11-1-2007(109): In the ancient <strong>parcel post</strong>, they just would <em>drag</em> the packages behind them tied to <em>cornstalks</em> woven into a long <em>belt</em> down the <em>road</em>. It was a wonder than anything arrived intact.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo">Elphalpo</a>] 1-9-2008(73): People complained about the delivery methods of UPS after finding out that they loaded<strong> parcel post</strong> onto a <em>towel</em> and <em>dragged</em> it down the <em>road</em>. As a result, UPS have completely revamped their delivery system. Now they use <em>two towels</em>. (thanks Virtua Leaf).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bexinkyushu">bexinkyushu</a>] 24-8-2011(13): According to Jim Breen (whom I'm always inclined to trust more than Heisig) the keyword for this kanji should be <strong>relay</strong> (as in to send something). Story: when amazon.com get a complaint about their<strong> parcel post</strong>, they <strong>relay</strong> a message of apology to the customer with a gift of <em>belted up cornstalk</em>. The message attached says "this gift of cornstalk has been <em>dragged</em> a long <em>road</em> straight from the amazon to your door"..</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata">Immacolata</a>] 8-5-2006(11): In the days before UPS and suchlike the<strong> parcel post</strong> had to walk on the long country roads from town to town. This one is dragging behind him a sled full of packages and for himself he has a cornstalk hanging from his belt, as supplies.</p>
