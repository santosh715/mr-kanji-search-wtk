<h2>Koohii stories:</h2>
<p>1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir">raulir</a>] 4-1-2007(165): This character refers to feudal<strong> clan</strong>s that were abolished in 1871 (Meiji 4) in favor of prefectures ( 廃藩置県 ), and thus were predecessors of the modern prefectures. As we know from 落 , flowers and water drops each have their own way of falling. This character says that<strong> clan</strong>s' location was decided in the way flowers, water drops and dice fall: at random. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29</a>.</p>

<p>2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew">Matthew</a>] 17-3-2009(132): In the particular<strong> clan</strong> depicted by this character, each member has to take his or her <em>turn</em> <em>watering</em> the <em>flowers</em>.</p>

<p>3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman">dwhitman</a>] 20-2-2008(83): Each member of the<strong> clan</strong> has to take his <em>turn</em> at <em>water</em>ing the <em>flowers</em>. The order they do it in is decided by a roll of the <em>dice</em>. (tweaked Matthew's story).</p>

<p>4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laxxy">laxxy</a>] 30-10-2006(27): This yakuza<strong> clan</strong> controls the "flower" trade, the 'water business' ( 水商 ) and the dice gambling.</p>

<p>5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan">erikkusan</a>] 5-4-2006(19): This is what members of Ku Klux<strong> Clan</strong> is doing when not meeting: pretending to live normal life by watering flowers during the day and playing dice-games with their families at night. What a double-life.</p>
